# Model Improvements for Automatic Music Transcription

This document summarizes the key model-related changes made to improve the AMT project.

## Key Changes

### Model Selection

1. **Replaced non-existent model** - Changed `sander-wood/midi-bert` (which doesn't exist) to `microsoft/musicbert-small` (verified to exist on Hugging Face)

2. **Added MusicBERT support** - Implemented proper support for Microsoft's MusicBERT, which is specifically trained for symbolic music understanding tasks

### Technical Improvements

1. **Enhanced model loading** - Updated `_load_pretrained_model` method in `midi_processor.py` to:
   - Detect and load Hugging Face models
   - Handle transformer models properly
   - Fall back to local models when needed
   - Include proper error handling

2. **Improved feature extraction** - Enhanced `extract_features_with_pretrained` to:
   - Work with transformer-based models via their forward method
   - Handle attention masks for transformer models
   - Extract meaningful embeddings from hidden states
   - Support both token-level and sequence-level embeddings

3. **Kaggle compatibility** - Added robust path handling for Kaggle environments:
   - Auto-detection of Kaggle environment
   - Searching common Kaggle MIDI paths
   - Fall back to general file search when needed

4. **Improved paired data handling** - Updated to work with the actual JSON structure:
   - Support for both direct text and text files
   - Handle the `pairs` array format
   - Support for metadata fields
   
## Benefits of MusicBERT

[MusicBERT](https://github.com/microsoft/muzic/tree/main/musicbert) from Microsoft offers significant advantages over other models:

1. **Music-specific pretraining** - MusicBERT is specifically pretrained on music data, making it more effective for music understanding tasks

2. **Large-scale training** - Trained on the Lakh MIDI dataset with 100K+ songs

3. **State-of-the-art performance** - Achieves excellent results on symbolic music tasks:
   - Melody extraction
   - Emotion recognition
   - Style classification 
   - Genre identification

4. **Easy integration** - Available on Hugging Face Hub and compatible with the transformers library

## Usage Example

```python
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoConfig

# Load MusicBERT
config = AutoConfig.from_pretrained("microsoft/musicbert-small")
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("microsoft/musicbert-small", config=config)

# Now ready for music understanding tasks
```

## Future Recommendations

1. **Consider MERT model** - For audio-based music understanding, consider using the MERT model (`m-a-p/MERT-v1-95M` or `m-a-p/MERT-v1-330M`)

2. **Explore MidiBERT-Piano** - For piano-specific tasks, explore using `wazenmai/MIDI-BERT` which is specialized for piano music

3. **Fine-tuning approach** - Implement a fine-tuning script specifically for MusicBERT to optimize for downstream AMT tasks
