# Overview

## Introduction to AMT

AMT (Automated Music Transcription) is a system designed to bridge the gap between audio recordings of music and their symbolic representations. Using state-of-the-art transformer models, AMT can:

1. Convert MIDI files to descriptive text
2. Generate MIDI files from text descriptions
3. Analyze musical patterns and structures
4. Create variations of existing music

## How It Works

At its core, AMT uses a bidirectional transformer architecture that can encode both musical data (in MIDI format) and textual descriptions. The system is trained on paired data of MIDI files and their corresponding textual descriptions.

### Key Components

- **Data Collection**: Tools for collecting and pairing MIDI files with text descriptions
- **Data Processing**: Preprocessing pipelines for both MIDI and text data
- **Model Training**: Training scripts and configurations for the transformer models
- **Generation**: Tools for generating new music from text or variations of existing music
- **Evaluation**: Metrics and tools for evaluating the quality of transcriptions and generations

## System Architecture

The AMT system follows a modular architecture with the following main components:

```
+----------------+     +----------------+     +----------------+
|                |     |                |     |                |
|  Data          |---->|  Model         |---->|  Generation    |
|  Processing    |     |  Training      |     |  & Evaluation  |
|                |     |                |     |                |
+----------------+     +----------------+     +----------------+
        ^                                            |
        |                                            |
        +--------------------------------------------+
                        Feedback Loop
```

## Use Cases

AMT can be used for a variety of applications, including:

- **Music Education**: Generate practice exercises or analyze student performances
- **Composition Assistance**: Help composers translate their ideas into music
- **Music Analysis**: Extract patterns and structures from existing music
- **Creative Tools**: Generate new music based on textual descriptions
