This piece is a gentle piano nocturne in the key of E-flat major. It begins with a flowing melody in the right hand, accompanied by arpeggiated chords in the left hand. The tempo is moderato (around 80-90 BPM) with a 4/4 time signature. The dynamics start softly (piano) and gradually build to a more passionate middle section (mezzo-forte) before returning to the original gentle theme. The piece features occasional ornamentations like trills and grace notes, giving it a classical romantic character reminiscent of Chopin's style. The harmonic progression is primarily diatonic with some chromatic passages for emotional emphasis.
