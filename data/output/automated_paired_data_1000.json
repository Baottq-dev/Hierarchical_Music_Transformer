        "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wouldn%27t_It_Be_Nice",
        "text_description": "\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" is a song by the American rock band the Beach Boys and the opening track from their 1966 album Pet Sounds. Written by Brian Wilson, Tony Asher, and Mike Love, it is distinguished for its sophisticated Wall of Sound-style arrangement and refined vocal performances, and is regarded among the band's finest songs. With its juxtaposition of joyous-sounding music and melancholic lyrics, it is considered a formative work of power pop, and with respect to musical innovation, progressive pop. The song was inspired by Wilson's confused infatuations for his sister-in-law, who projected an \"innocent aura\" that he wished to capture in \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\". Lyrically, the song describes a young couple who feel empowered by their relationship and fantasize about the romantic freedom they would earn once married to each other. Like the other tracks on Pet Sounds, it subverted listeners' expectations, as past Beach Boys songs had normally celebrated superficial conceits such as material possessions and casual flings. Wilson produced the record between January and April 1966 with his band and 16 studio musicians who variously played drums, timpani, glockenspiel, trumpet, saxophones, accordions, guitars, pianos, and upright bass. The harp-like instrument heard in the introduction is a 12-string mando-guitar plugged directly into the recording console. One section of the song engages in a ritardando, a device that is rarely used in pop music. The band struggled to sing the multiple vocal parts to Wilson's satisfaction, and the song ultimately took longer to record than any other track on the album. \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" was released as a single in July and peaked at number 8 on the Billboard Hot 100. It has occasionally appeared in the soundtracks of films such as the 1989 documentary Roger & Me, where it was used to underscore visuals of economic devastation. As of 2021, it was the band's most streamed song on Spotify."

It was released on 23 September 1991 as the lead single from their debut album, Get Ready! (1992). Originally, the single was produced as an instrumental track in May 1991, titled the \"Orchestral Mix\". It became a hit and conscious of their popularity, Wilde & De Coster wanted a more accessible, formatted formula for their project to grow. Ray was then asked to write lyrics and add a rap to the track. On Ray Slijngaard's suggestion, Anita Doth joined as the female vocalist. The single was an immediate success throughout Europe with notable peaks worldwide, including Australia and the US. It is arguably the most famous of the band's singles in the United States having charted at number 14 on the US Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart, number 17 on the Billboard Top 40/Mainstream chart and number 38 on the Billboard Hot 100, making it the band's only top-40 hit in the US. In the UK, the single went to number two on the UK Singles Chart. The song is one of the most frequently played songs at sporting events around the world. It earned one of BMI's Pop Awards of 1996, and in 2010, Pitchfork included it in their list of \"Ten Actually Good 90s Jock Jams\"."

        "text_description": "\"Twilight Zone\" is a song by Belgian/Dutch Eurodance act 2 Unlimited, released in January 1992 by Byte Records as the second single from the act's debut studio album, Get Ready! (1992). The UK release of the single was the first 2 Unlimited single to include the vocals of Anita Doth, as they had not been featured on their breakthrough hit \"Get Ready for This\". However, Ray Slijngaard's rap verses were once again removed. The instrumental \"Rave\" version of the song sounds different from the original \"Not Enough\" version, with a more hi-NRG style with more bass and added cowbells. The music video was directed by David Betteridge. \"Twilight Zone\" was a commercial success in many European territories, topping the singles charts of Finland, Ireland and the Netherlands, and reaching number two on the UK Singles Chart. It was 2 Unlimited's biggest hit on the US Hot Dance Club Play chart, reaching number five, and it won an award in the category for Best Techno 12-inch Single on the 1993 WMC International Dance Music Awards."

        "text_description": "Tiziano Ferro (Italian: [tit\u02c8tsja\u02d0no \u02c8f\u025brro]; born 21 February 1980) is an Italian pop singer and songwriter. He broke through in 2001 with his international hit single \"Perdono\" and has remained commercially successful since then, in several countries. Ferro has released a Spanish version of each of his albums and has also sung in English, Portuguese, and French. Known as the modern face of Italian pop music, he frequently writes songs for other artists and has produced albums for Giusy Ferreri, Alessandra Amoroso, and Baby K. Aside from his success as an artist, Ferro is well known for his personal struggles. Having been overweight as a teenager, he has been outspoken about his battles with food addiction and eating disorders. In October 2010, at the height of his fame, Ferro came out as gay, having himself struggled with depression related to self-acceptance about his homosexuality. Ferro is currently one of the best-selling artists in Italy. Both his third album Nessuno \u00e8 solo and fourth album Alla mia et\u00e0 were certified diamond by the Federazione Industria Musicale Italiana. Despite his fears, his coming out did not negatively affect his career, as his fifth album L'amore \u00e8 una cosa semplice was the best-selling album of 2012 in Italy, and his first greatest hits album was supported by a stadium tour. As of 2023, Ferro has sold over 20 million records worldwide."

In his career, spanning four decades, Fornaciari has sold over 60 million records around the world, and internationally his most successful singles are \"Diamante\", \"Il Volo/My Love\", \"Baila (Sexy Thing)/Baila morena\", and the duet \"Senza una donna (Without a Woman)\" with Paul Young. He has won numerous awards, including four Festivalbar, nine Wind Music Awards, two World Music Awards (1993, 1996), six IFPI Europe Platinum Awards, and a Grammy Award nomination. He has collaborated and performed with many famous artists, including Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Brian May, Miles Davis, Ray Charles, Billy Preston, John Lee Hooker, Scorpions, Sheryl Crow, Blues Brothers Band, Elvis Costello, Roland Orzabal, Joe Cocker, Sharon Corr, B.

She rose to fame in 1993, winning the newcomer artists' section of the 43rd Sanremo Music Festival with the song \"La solitudine\", which became an Italian standard and an international hit. Her self-titled debut album was released in Italy on 23 April 1993 and later became an international success, selling two million copies worldwide. Its follow-up, Laura, was released in 1994 and confirmed her international success, selling three million copies worldwide. Pausini has released fifteen studio albums, two international greatest hits albums and one compilation album for the Anglophone market only. She mostly performs in Italian and Spanish, but has also recorded and sung songs in Portuguese, English, French, German, Latin, Chinese, Catalan, Neapolitan, Romanian, Romagnol and Sicilian. In 2004, AllMusic's Jason Birchmeier considered Pausini's sales \"an impressive feat for someone who'd never really broken into the lucrative English-language market\". In 2014, FIMI certified Pausini's sales of more than 70 million records with a FIMI Icon Award, making her the fourth best-selling female artist in Latin music, and the best-selling non-Spanish speaking female Latin music artist. In 2025, she ranked 9th on Billboard's \"Best 50 Female Latin Pop Artists of All Time\" list. Pausini appeared as a coach on both the Mexican and Spanish versions of international reality television singing competition franchise The Voice, was a judge on the first and second series of La banda, and was likewise a judge on the Spanish version of international franchise The X Factor. In 2016, she debuted as a variety show presenter, hosting the television show Laura & Paola, with actress Paola Cortellesi. She was also one of the presenters of the Eurovision Song Contest 2022. Throughout her career, she has won numerous music awards in Italy and internationally. In 2006, she won a Grammy Award, receiving the accolade for Best Latin Pop Album for the record Escucha. In 2021, she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song with \"Io s\u00ec (Seen)\" from the film The Life Ahead. The single also won the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song, making it the first Italian-language song to win the award. She has been honoured as a Commander Order of Merit of the Italian Republic by President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi and as a World Ambassador of Emilia Romagna."

Their first Christmas album This Christmas has sold over two million copies and is widely recognized as one of the most successful holiday albums ever. The pop and R&B group was started independently by Jeff Timmons in Los Angeles, California, although all of its members originate from Ohio. Unlike most boy bands, they were later picked up by a record label, rather than being assembled by a label or a producer. They have sold over 10 million records worldwide and achieved eight top 40 singles in the U.S. Between late 1997 and 2000, the group reached top-twenty status on the Billboard U.S. Hot 100 chart, with their debut single \"Invisible Man\" peaking at No. 12, and 1999's pop/R&B cover of the country ballad \"I Do (Cherish You)\" peaking at No. 13. The group successfully charted in the U.S. top five with \"Give Me Just One Night (Una Noche)\", \"Because of You\", \"The Hardest Thing\", and \"Thank God I Found You\"\u2014the latter as a guest artist backing Mariah Carey to give 98 Degrees their only number-one song, which earned a Grammy Award nomination for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals. Beginning with an August 2012 performance at the Mixtape Festival in Hershey, Pennsylvania, the group reunited and continues to record new music."

It was written by Static Major and Timbaland, with the latter producing it, in addition to performing a guest rap. It was sent to urban contemporary radio stations in the United States on May 26, 1998, by Blackground Records and Atlantic Records. Musically, it is an R&B, pop, and avant-funk song with hip hop influences. Its production also incorporates other instrumentals such as staccato guitars, beatboxing, and drum and bass. Lyrically, it is about the narrator (Aaliyah) keeping an intimate relationship a secret due to her celebrity status. Upon its release, the song received critical acclaim from music critics, with them praising its off-beat innovative production. In 1999, Aaliyah earned a Grammy Award nomination for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance for the song. Initially, it was ineligible to chart on the Billboard Hot 100, mainly because it was an airplay single not commercially released to retail stores. In December 1998, Billboard changed its policy to allow airplay-only songs to chart on the Hot 100, and the song eventually peaked at number 21. Internationally, the song achieved even greater commercial success, peaking at number one in New Zealand and number three in the Netherlands. It also peaked at number 11 in Canada and the United Kingdom. An accompanying music video for \"Are You That Somebody?\" was directed by Mark Gerard. It is a dance-heavy video that depicts Aaliyah and other dancers all dancing in a cave before a backdrop that features clips of the Dr. Dolittle motion picture. The video received acclaim from the music industry, receiving Best R&B Video and Best Video from a Film nominations at the 1999 MTV Video Music Awards. The video also earned a nomination for Outstanding Music Video at the NAACP Image Awards. Throughout the years, critics have praised the video for its choreography, with many highlighting the flamenco routine depicted in the final scene."

The intro contains an interpolation from Eric B. & Rakim's song \"I Know You Got Soul\" (1987). Lyrically, the narrator (Aaliyah) encourages a potential partner not to give up when she initially rejects his advances. The song received critical acclaim from music critics for its innovative futuristic production. In retrospective reviews, critics have credited the song for helping \"smuggle the innovative techniques of electronic dance music onto the American pop charts\". In 2001, Aaliyah earned a Grammy Award nomination for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance for the song at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards. Aside from its critical success, the song enjoyed commercial success as well. In the United States, it peaked atop the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the first single to reach number one based solely on airplay.

        "text_description": "\"Another Town, Another Train\" is a song recorded by Swedish pop group ABBA at KMH Studios. The song was released as a 7\" vinyl single in Japan in March 1973 to promote the group's debut album Ring Ring; the single was also released with the same B-side (\"People Need Love\") in Venezuela. \"Another Town, Another Train\" was also released as a single on Playboy Records in the USA, with \"I Am Just A Girl\" on the B-side, as a follow-up to the group's first single \"People Need Love\". The single was released in South Africa and Rhodesia on the Sunshine label with \"Rock'n Roll Band\" on the B-side. After the success of the Ring Ring single, it was the intention for \"Another Town, Another Train\" to be released as a follow-up single in Holland which never materialised. The first release in the UK was on Abba's first compilation album Greatest Hits. Written and performed in the style of Simon and Garfunkel and The Bachelors, the melodic ballad tells of the song's narrator leaving his love as \"day is dawning\". It was recorded in German under the title \"Wer im Wartesaal der Liebe steht\" (with lyrics by Fred Jay), as the B-side to the German version of \"Ring Ring\". With lyrics in Swedish by Stikkan Andersson, \"En annan stad, en annan v\u00e4n\", it was covered by dance band Schytts in 1974, and by fellow Eurovision participant Kikki Danielsson in 1991 on her album \"V\u00e4gen hem till dej\"."

It became ABBA's only number one hit in the United States, and topped the charts in Australia, Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, Portugal, Norway, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, West Germany and the Soviet Union. \"Dancing Queen\" also reached the top five in many other countries. Musically, \"Dancing Queen\" is a Europop version of American disco music. As disco music dominated the US charts, the group decided to follow the trend, replicating Phil Spector's Wall of Sound arrangements. Andersson and Ulvaeus have cited George McCrae's \"Rock Your Baby\" as a source of inspiration for the style of the song. The song alternates between \"languid yet seductive verses\" and a \"dramatic chorus that ascends to heart-tugging high notes\". It features keyboard lines by Andersson, which accentuate the melody's sophistication and classical complexity, while Ulvaeus and Andersson interlace many instrumental hooks in and out of the mix. Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad\u2019s layered vocals have been noted for their dynamism, \"[negotiating] the melody's many turns flawlessly.\" Lyrically, the song concerns a visit to the discoth\u00e8que, but approaches the subject from the joy of dancing itself.

Andersson and Ulvaeus have cited George McCrae's \"Rock Your Baby\" as a source of inspiration for the style of the song. The song alternates between \"languid yet seductive verses\" and a \"dramatic chorus that ascends to heart-tugging high notes\". It features keyboard lines by Andersson, which accentuate the melody's sophistication and classical complexity, while Ulvaeus and Andersson interlace many instrumental hooks in and out of the mix. Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad\u2019s layered vocals have been noted for their dynamism, \"[negotiating] the melody's many turns flawlessly.\" Lyrically, the song concerns a visit to the discoth\u00e8que, but approaches the subject from the joy of dancing itself. In 2015, the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame."

For the writing, Ulvaeus was inspired by a young fan he met, and who which he turned away from due to her age. A success for the group, \"Does Your Mother Know\" reached number one on the music charts in Belgium, and reached the top ten in eight other countries. Its North American chart performance was moderate, reaching numbers 12 and 19 on the Canadian RPM Top Singles and US Billboard Hot 100 charts. Ulvaeus later said that the track would have been a bigger hit if F\u00e4ltskog or Lyngstad sang the lead vocals instead. In 2019, the single was re-released as a vinyl picture disc."

        "text_description": "\"Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)\" is a song by Swedish recording group ABBA. A disco song, it was first recorded in August 1979 to promote the group's North American and European concert legs of ABBA: The Tour. It was released on 12 October 1979 as the sole single taken from their second greatest hits album Greatest Hits Vol. 2 (1979). Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog sang the lead vocals to the song. Although it was not recorded for it, \"Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)\" was included in reissues of the group's sixth studio album Voulez-Vous (1979). The track went on to become one of ABBA's signature hits, topping the charts in Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, and Japan's international chart, and reached the top ten in multiple countries across Europe and Australia as well. Its release in the United States and Canada was cancelled by Atlantic Records even though promotional copies were already pressed, presumably due to the unpopularity of disco as a whole in the US following Disco Demolition Night."

        "text_description": "The Complete Studio Recordings is a box set of all of the studio material released by the Swedish pop group ABBA. It was released on 7 November 2005 and consists of 9 CDs and 2 DVDs, plus a full color booklet with a timeline and photos. Another booklet containing complete lyrics to all of the music was also included. There is one CD for each of ABBA's 8 studio albums. These CDs also include bonus tracks in the form of non-album tracks and foreign language versions. The final CD contains additional rare tracks, including songs released after the group had disbanded. Of particular interest is the rare alternate mix of \"Waterloo\", which has never been available on CD before. The extended mono version of \"On and On and On\"\u2014featuring an extra verse and previously only available as the soundtrack to the song's video\u2014is also released on CD for the first time. The two DVDs feature all of the band's music videos (except for the \"When I Kissed the Teacher\" video), plus a documentary (The History) and concert footage from the television special Dick Cavett Meets ABBA, a co-production between Polar Music International and Sveriges Television (SVT). Five of the performances from this program are included on the DVD, as four of the original nine songs are no longer to be found in the SVT archives. The Complete Studio Recordings was only available for a short period of time and in limited numbers. However, a simpler version of the box set featuring only the 9 CDs and the timeline booklet was released in Denmark in 2006. The box set was re-released in 2008 to coincide with the release of Mamma Mia! but had limited chart success, mainly due to its high price tag. As of 2020, The Complete Studio Recordings is not in print and many of the tracks included have made their way on to deluxe editions of ABBA's established albums. As of 2021, this set is no longer \u201ccomplete\u201d as ABBA released the reunion album Voyage."

The B-side, \"Crazy World\", was recorded in 1976 during the sessions for the ABBA album. The song (originally titled \"Gypsy Girl\") is sung from the viewpoint of a woman who, despite hard work, can barely keep her finances in surplus, and therefore desires a well-off man. ABBA perform parts of \"Money, Money, Money\" live in the 1977 film ABBA: The Movie. In the popular musical, Mamma Mia!, the song is sung by the character of Donna as she explains how hard she has to work to keep the taverna in order and her dreams of a better life."

Written by Benny Andersson and Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus, who also produced it, the song has lead vocals by Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog and is about a woman trying to revive a relationship she had ended. It would become ABBA's last major hit for 40 years, and the last No. 1 single of their career, topping the charts in Belgium, Denmark, West Germany, Ireland and the Netherlands. \"One of Us\" was also a Top 10 hit in countries like Austria, Norway, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland and the UK. \"One of Us\" wasn't released as a single in North America until 1983, to promote the 1982 compilation \"The Singles\". In the US, it only charted on the Billboard Bubbling Under the Hot 100 chart and the Adult Contemporary chart, peaking at number 107 and 33, respectively. In the US, the first single from The Visitors album was instead \"When All Is Said and Done\". The music video for the song was directed by Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m, featuring F\u00e4ltskog as a woman moving into her new house. It has since been covered by Pandora in 1995, A-Teens in 1999 and Cher in 2018. In 2017, Billboard named \"One of Us\" the fifth best ABBA song in their list of \"The 15 Best ABBA Songs\"."

They are one of the most popular and successful musical groups of all time, and are one of the best-selling music acts in the history of popular music. In 1974, ABBA became Sweden's first winner of the Eurovision Song Contest with the song \"Waterloo\", which in 2005 was chosen as the best song in the competition's history as part of the 50th anniversary celebration of the contest. During the band's main active years, it consisted of two couples: F\u00e4ltskog and Ulvaeus, and Lyngstad and Andersson. With the increase of their popularity, their personal lives suffered, which eventually resulted in the collapse of both marriages. The relationship changes were reflected in the group's music, with later songs featuring darker and more introspective lyrics. After ABBA disbanded in December 1982, Andersson and Ulvaeus continued their success writing music for multiple audiences including stage, musicals and movies, while F\u00e4ltskog and Lyngstad pursued solo careers. Ten years after the group broke up, a compilation, ABBA Gold, was released, becoming a worldwide best-seller. In 1999, ABBA's music was adapted into Mamma Mia!, a stage musical that toured worldwide and, as of October 2024, is still in the top-ten longest running productions on both Broadway (closed in 2015) and the West End (still running). A film of the same name, released in 2008, became the highest-grossing film in the United Kingdom that year. A sequel, Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again, was released in 2018. ABBA have record sales estimated to be between 150 million to 385 million sold worldwide and the group were ranked 3rd best-selling singles artists in the United Kingdom with a total of 11.3 million singles sold by 3 November 2012. In May 2023, ABBA were awarded the BRIT Billion Award, which celebrates those who have surpassed the milestone of one billion UK streams in their career. ABBA were the first group from a non-English-speaking country to achieve consistent success in the charts of English-speaking countries, including the United Kingdom, Australia, United States, Republic of Ireland, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa. They are the best-selling Swedish band of all time and the best-selling band originating in continental Europe. ABBA had eight consecutive number-one albums in the UK. The group also enjoyed significant success in Latin America and recorded a collection of their hit songs in Spanish. ABBA were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2002. The group were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2010, the first recording artists to receive this honour from outside an Anglophonic country. In 2015, their song \"Dancing Queen\" was inducted into the Recording Academy's Grammy Hall of Fame. In 2024, the United States Library of Congress included the album Arrival (1976) in the National Recording Registry, which recognises works \"worthy of preservation for all time based on their cultural, historical or aesthetic importance in the nation\u2019s recorded sound heritage\". In 2016, the group reunited and started working on a digital avatar concert tour. Newly recorded songs were announced in 2018. Voyage, their first new album in 40 years, was released on 5 November 2021 to positive critical reviews and strong sales.

The song is accompanied by footage of a studio recording session, a live stage performance and a mimed studio performance by the four members of the group. The song also plays over the closing titles as the camera pans out from the band performing in a hut on an island in the Stockholm archipelago to views of the archipelago itself. The song was re-released in November 1983, to promote the Epic Records compilation album of the same name."

The song is accompanied by footage of a studio recording session, a live stage performance and a mimed studio performance by the four members of the group. The song also plays over the closing titles as the camera pans out from the band performing in a hut on an island in the Stockholm archipelago to views of the archipelago itself. The song was re-released in November 1983, to promote the Epic Records compilation album of the same name."

With The Visitors, ABBA took several steps away from the \"lighter\" pop music they had recorded previously and the album is often regarded as a more complex and mature effort. The opening track, \"The Visitors\", with its ominous synthesizer sounds and the distinctive lead vocal by Frida, announced a change in musical style. With Benny and Frida going their separate ways, the pain of splitting up was explored yet again in \"When All Is Said and Done\". The major hit single on the album, \"One of Us\", also depicted the end of a love story. Elsewhere there were Cold War themes\u2014highly topical at the time\u2014and further songs of isolation and regret. The Visitors was one of the first records ever to be digitally recorded and mixed, as well as one of the earliest in history to be pressed on the CD format in 1983. The Visitors has been reissued in digitally remastered form four times\u2014first in 1997, then in 2001, again in 2005 as part of The Complete Studio Recordings box set and most recently in 2012, as part of the \"Deluxe Edition\" series.

They are best known as pioneers of the new wave and sophisti-pop movements, blending synth-pop with orchestral and jazz influences. The band achieved mainstream success with their debut album, The Lexicon of Love (1982), which featured the hit singles \"The Look of Love\" and \"Poison Arrow\" and reached number one on the UK Albums Chart. Fronted by Martin Fry, the band's only constant member, the band's classic formation featured Fry as the lead vocalist, Mark White on guitar and keyboards, Stephen Singleton on saxophone, and David Palmer on drums. ABC achieved ten UK and five US top 40 hit singles from 1981 to 1990. Their 1982 debut studio album, The Lexicon of Love, was a UK number one. Their early-1980s success in the US saw them associated with the Second British Invasion. ABC continued to release music throughout the 1980s, with notable albums such as Beauty Stab (1983) and How to Be a...Zillionaire! (1985), the latter producing hits in both the UK and the United States. Although their commercial success declined after the 1980s, ABC have remained active through live performances, reissues, and occasional new material. In 2016, Fry released The Lexicon of Love II, a sequel to their debut album, which was well received by both critics and fans."

It was released as the third single from The Fame Monster on April 20, 2010. Interscope Records intended \"Dance in the Dark\" to be the EP's third single after \"Alejandro\" initially received limited airplay, but Gaga insisted on the latter. Written and produced by Gaga alongside Moroccan-Swedish producer RedOne, \"Alejandro\" was inspired by Gaga's fear of men and is about her bidding farewell to her Latino lovers named Alejandro, Roberto and Fernando. Musically, it is a synth-pop song with Europop and Latin pop beats, and opens with a sample from the main melody of Vittorio Monti's \"Cs\u00e1rd\u00e1s\". Upon its release, \"Alejandro\" received generally mixed reviews from music critics; some praised the song's catchiness and production while others criticized it as unoriginal, mainly due to the influence from the Swedish pop groups ABBA and Ace of Base. Retrospective reviewers ranked the song as one of Gaga's best singles.

It was a Top 5 hit single in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United States. In a 2017 journal, which studied structural patterns in melodies of earworm songs, the American Psychological Association (APA) called \"Alejandro\" one of the world's catchiest. The accompanying music video, directed by American fashion photographer Steven Klein, was inspired by Gaga's admiration of her gay friends and gay love. In the video, Gaga dances with male soldiers in a cabaret, interspersed with scenes of near-naked men holding machine guns and the singer playing a nun who swallows a rosary. Critics complimented the music video's idea and dark nature, and compared it with the work of 1980s artists. The Catholic League criticized Gaga's use of religious symbols in the video. Retrospective commentators analyzed the music video's themes, including BDSM, anti-fascism, sexual violence and religion. Gaga performed \"Alejandro\" on the ninth season of American Idol and many of her concert tours and residency shows."

The album presented an experiment with pop music in the band's signature style using strong memorable melody lines. The most successful track is \"Catalina Kiss\", the album opener and a longstanding live favourite. Using a shuffle rhythm, the track calls upon the saxophone for embellishments, whilst tonal harmonies between the two guitars evoke a strong melody. JazzTrax host Art Good suggested that the song was inspired by a performance the band performed at the Catalina Island Jazz Festival in 1988."

The other two new tracks were instrumentals. \"Who Made Who\" reached number nine in Australia, number one in Finland, and number 23 on the US Billboard Album Rock Tracks chart. In addition to the song itself, \"Who Made Who\" has also been played live, mostly throughout the subsequent world tour and the Blow Up Your Video World Tour. It was also played live with replacement drummer Chris Slade throughout The Razors Edge World Tour, and with drummer Phil Rudd (who returned to the band in 1994 after being fired from the group 11 years prior) for only one gig at the opening night of the Ballbreaker World Tour in Greensboro, North Carolina, after which the song was dropped and has not been played live since. A live version was released on the 1992 album AC/DC Live."

        "text_description": "This is a partial list of notable people who were or are gay men, lesbian or bisexual. The historical concept and definition of sexual orientation varies and has changed greatly over time; for example the general term \"gay\" was not used to describe sexual orientation until the mid 20th century. A number of different classification schemes have been used to describe sexual orientation since the mid-19th century, and scholars have often defined the term \"sexual orientation\" in divergent ways. Indeed, several studies have found that much of the research about sexual orientation has failed to define the term at all, making it difficult to reconcile the results of different studies. However, most definitions include a psychological component (such as the direction of an individual's erotic desire) and/or a behavioural component (which focuses on the sex of the individual's sexual partner/s). Some prefer to simply follow an individual's self-definition or identity. The high prevalence of people from the West on this list may be due to societal attitudes towards homosexuality. The Pew Research Center's 2013 Global Attitudes Survey found that there is \u201cgreater acceptance in more secular and affluent countries,\u201d with \"publics in 39 countries [having] broad acceptance of homosexuality in North America, the European Union, and much of Latin America, but equally widespread rejection in predominantly Muslim nations and in Africa, as well as in parts of Asia and in Russia. Opinion about the acceptability of homosexuality is divided in Israel, Poland and Bolivia.\u201d As of 2013, Americans are divided \u2013 a majority (60 percent) believes homosexuality should be accepted, while 33 percent disagree."

It was first released as a single in the United Kingdom on October 24, 1994, as a double A-side with \"Crazy\", then was issued in the United States by itself the following month. \"Blind Man\" served as the first single from Aerosmith's Geffen-era compilation album, Big Ones, one of three songs from the record not previously released on any Aerosmith studio album. Despite the song's moderate success, reaching the top 10 in Canada, Finland, and Norway, the band rarely performed it live after the 1993\u20131994 Get a Grip Tour. The accompanying music video was directed by Marty Callner, featuring a cameo by Pamela Anderson."

Get a Grip was the band's last studio album to be released by Geffen before they returned to Columbia Records. Get a Grip featured guests including Don Henley, who sang backup on \"Amazing\", and Lenny Kravitz, who offered backup vocals and collaboration to \"Line Up\". As on Permanent Vacation and Pump, this album featured numerous song collaborators from outside the band including: Desmond Child, Jim Vallance, Mark Hudson, Richie Supa, Taylor Rhodes, Jack Blades, and Tommy Shaw. Get a Grip became Aerosmith's best-selling studio album worldwide, achieving sales of over 20 million copies. The album became the band's first album to reach number one in the United States and tied with Pump for their second best-selling album in the U.S., selling over 7 million copies as of 1995 (Toys in the Attic leads with nine million). This also made it their third consecutive album with U.S. sales of at least five million. Two songs from the album won Grammy Awards for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, in 1993 and 1994. The album was voted Album of the Year by Metal Edge readers in the magazine's 1993 Readers' Choice Awards, while \"Livin' on the Edge\" was voted Best Video."

Columbia Records chose to service top 40 radio stations with both long and short versions of the song, thus many 1976 pop radio listeners were exposed to the group's first top 10 effort through the 45 edit. In 2004, Rolling Stone magazine ranked the song at number 172 on its list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. It was moved to number 173 in 2010, and re-ranked at number 199 in 2021. In 2007, Aerosmith would perform a re-recording of the song, among some of their other songs, for the game Guitar Hero: Aerosmith as the master track was missing during the game's development. In 2018, the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. On November 29, 2023, the song surpassed one billion streams on Spotify."

It is regarded as a key influence in the early development of heavy metal. In 1976, the song was released as the B-side of \"Got to Get You into My Life\" in the United States, to promote the Capitol Records compilation Rock 'n' Roll Music. Along with other tracks from the White Album, \"Helter Skelter\" was interpreted by cult leader Charles Manson as a message predicting inter-racial war in the US. A vision of this uprising was named after the song. Rolling Stone magazine ranked \"Helter Skelter\" 52nd on its list of \"The 100 Greatest Beatles Songs\". Siouxsie and the Banshees, M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce, Aerosmith, U2, Oasis and Pat Benatar are among the artists who have covered the track, and McCartney has frequently performed it in concert."

        "text_description": "\"Come What May\" is a song written by David Baerwald and Kevin Gilbert, originally intended for the film William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet. However, it debuted in, and is best known as the romantic love theme from, Baz Luhrmann's 2001 film Moulin Rouge!, in which Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman sing it in their respective roles as Christian and Satine. The song takes its title from a phrase that originates from Shakespeare's Twelfth Night (1601) and later appears Macbeth (1606). The song plays an important role in the film. After Christian and Satine's forbidden, strong, and close romantic relationship has been discovered, Christian pens this song and includes it in the musical he is currently writing. Each time either of them sings this song, they can secretly declare their equally deep and true romantic love for each other. The version of the song on the soundtrack album differs slightly from the version in the film. The lyrics \"Every day I love you more and more\" and \"Listen to my heart, can you hear it sing/Telling me to give you everything\" are part of the song on the soundtrack version. However, in the movie, they are replaced by a musical interlude the first time and, the second time, Satine sings instead of the latter part, \"Come back to me and forgive everything.\" The single version can be found on the original soundtrack, while the original film version can be found on the follow-up soundtrack. It was released as a single in Australia where it became the eighth highest-selling single by an Australian artist of 2001. It was also released in Germany, and the UK, where it charted at #27."

The band was founded by Randy Owen (lead vocals, rhythm guitar) and his cousin Teddy Gentry (bass, backing vocals). They were soon joined by another cousin, Jeff Cook (lead guitar, fiddle, and keyboards). First operating under the name Young Country and later Wildcountry, the group toured the Southeast bar circuit in the early 1970s, and began writing original songs. They changed their name to Alabama in 1977 and following the chart success of two singles, were approached by RCA Records for a recording deal. Alabama's biggest success came in the 1980s, when the band had 27 country No. 1 hits, seven multi-platinum albums, and received numerous major awards. Alabama's first single on RCA Records, \"Tennessee River\", began a streak of 21 country No. 1 singles, including \"Love in the First Degree\" (1981), \"Mountain Music\" (1982), \"Dixieland Delight\" (1983), \"If You're Gonna Play in Texas (You Gotta Have a Fiddle in the Band)\" (1984) and \"Song of the South\" (1988). The band's popularity waned slightly in the 1990s, although they continued to produce hit singles and multi-platinum albums. Alabama disbanded in 2004 following a farewell tour and two albums of inspirational music, but reunited in 2010 and has continued to record and tour worldwide. The band's blend of traditional country music and Southern rock combined with elements of bluegrass, folk and pop music gave it a crossover appeal that helped lead to their success. They also toured extensively and incorporated production elements such as lighting and sets inspired by rock concerts into their shows. The band has over 41 number-one country records on the Billboard charts to their credit and have sold over 75 million records, making them the most successful band in country music history. AllMusic credited the band with popularizing the idea of a country band and wrote that \"It's unlikely that any other country group will be able to surpass the success of Alabama.\" Alabama was inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in 2019 and was awarded the first-ever Life Time Achievement Award from this institution.

Credited with reviving the French chanson in \"a time of French musical turmoil\", he is often regarded as the most important French rock musician after Serge Gainsbourg. He rose to prominence in the early 1980s with hit songs such as \"Gaby oh Gaby\" and \"Vertige de l'amour\", and later had a string of hit records from the 1990s onward, such as \"Osez Jos\u00e9phine\", \"Ma petite entreprise\" and \"La nuit je mens\". He has had an influence on many later French artists, and is the most awarded artist in the Victoires de la Musique history with 12 victories obtained throughout his career. Bashung's Play blessures (1982), Osez Jos\u00e9phine (1991), and Fantaisie militaire (1998) have made multiple French lists of the greatest albums. L'Imprudence (2002) and Bleu p\u00e9trole (2008), the last two studio albums released during his lifetime, also garnered acclaim. Bashung died at 61 after a two-year fight with lung cancer."

After releasing two studio albums, Morissette left MCA Records Canada and was introduced to manager Scott Welch. Morissette began working on new music after moving from her hometown of Ottawa to Toronto, but made little progress. In Los Angeles, she met producer Glen Ballard, with whom she wrote songs including \"You Oughta Know\". Despite much speculation concerning whom the song is about, Morissette has never disclosed the person's identity and has never indicated an intention to do so. \"You Oughta Know\" signaled Morissette's departure from bubblegum pop to alternative rock, and features guitarist Dave Navarro and bassist Flea of Red Hot Chili Peppers. It outperformed the label's expectations and received positive reviews. After the influential Los Angeles modern rock radio station KROQ-FM began playing it, the single reached the top ten in Canada, Australia and the United States. It was a multiformat hit in several US genre charts, and made the top 40 in Belgium, Iceland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden and the United Kingdom. A music video was directed by Nick Egan. The single was added in the set list for Morissette's 1995 world tour; since then, it has been included in her albums MTV Unplugged (1999), Feast on Scraps (2002), and The Collection, as well as 1997 Grammys and the MTV Unplugged compilation albums. It has received numerous accolades; in 1996, the single was nominated for three Grammy Awards, winning the awards for Best Rock Song and Best Female Rock Vocal Performance. In 2021, the song was listed at #103 in the Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time."

Written by Alanis and Glen Ballard, and produced by Ballard, it was released as the album's fifth single outside of the United States in July 1996 and presented a softer sound than the previous singles from the album. \"Head over Feet\" talks about being best friends and lovers with someone at the same time, with Alanis thanking them for their manners, love and devotion. \"Head over Feet\" received positive response from critics, who described it as soft and light. The song became Morissette's first number-one hit on the US Billboard Adult Top 40 chart and also topped the Top 40/Mainstream chart. In the United Kingdom, it was her first top-10 single, and it reached the top 20 in Australia. In Canada, the song spent eight weeks at number one on the RPM 100 Hit Tracks Chart, the most of any of her four number-one songs from Jagged Little Pill. The single also peaked at number one in Iceland. A live version of \"Head over Feet\" is featured on the album Alanis Unplugged (1999), and an acoustic version of the song was recorded for the album Jagged Little Pill Acoustic (2005). The song is included in the Jagged Little Pill musical and is performed on the show's soundtrack by actors Celia Rose Gooding, Antonio Cipriano, Elizabeth Stanley and Sean Allan Krill. The song is the earliest known use of the term \"friend with benefits\"."

        "text_description": "Jagged Little Pill is the third studio album by Canadian-American singer Alanis Morissette, released by Maverick on June 13, 1995. Recorded in Hollywood at Westlake with production by Glen Ballard, it is Morissette's first album to be released worldwide. It marks a significant stylistic departure from the dance-pop sound of her first two efforts, Alanis (1991) and Now Is the Time (1992). She began work on the album after moving from her hometown Ottawa to Los Angeles, where she met Ballard. The pair had an instant connection and began co-writing and experimenting with sounds. The experimentation resulted in an alternative rock album that takes influence from post-grunge and pop rock, and features guitars, bass, keyboards, drum machines, and harmonica. The lyrics touch upon themes of aggression and unsuccessful relationships, while Ballard introduced a pop sensibility to Morissette's angst.

        "text_description": "\"Ironic\" is a song by Canadian singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette, released in February 1996 by Maverick and Warner Bros. Records as the third single (fourth in Japan) from her third studio album, Jagged Little Pill (1995). It was written by Morissette and Glen Ballard, and was produced by him. The lyrics present several unfortunate situations that are described as \"ironic\"; this has led to debate as to whether any of these match the accepted meaning of irony. For six weeks, the track topped the Canadian RPM 100 Hit Tracks chart, eventually becoming the second-most-successful song of the year in the country. It also reached the top five in Australia, New Zealand, and Norway. In the United States, the song reached number four on April 13, 1996, and since then it has been her highest-charting single on the Billboard Hot 100. \"Ironic\" was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The song won the Juno Award for Single of the Year, and received two Grammy Award nominations in 1997, for Record of the Year and Best Short Form Music Video. French director St\u00e9phane Sednaoui filmed the music video. In it, Morissette drives through a winter landscape, and she plays multiple roles as her passengers. MTV nominated the music video for six MTV Video Music Awards in 1996, winning three of them. The music video was listed on VH1's \"Greatest Music Videos\" list and was parodied by DBA Flip, Allison Rheaume, Rusty and \"Weird Al\" Yankovic. \"Ironic\" was included on the set list of Morissette's Jagged Little Pill World Tour (1995), and her compilation albums MTV Unplugged (1999), The Collection (2005), among others. The song was covered by Mexican duet Jesse & Joy for their album Esta Es Mi Vida Sesiones (2007), and by American band Four Year Strong for their cover album Explains It All (2009)."

A&M Records released \"King of Pain\" as the album's fourth single in the UK, while in many other countries it was released as the second single. The song received acclaim from music critics, many of whom praised Sting's lyrics and cited the song as a highlight from Synchronicity. It reached No. 3 in the US Billboard Hot 100 chart in October 1983, and No. 1 on the Billboard Top Tracks chart for five weeks in August 1983. In the United Kingdom, it reached No. 17 in January 1984, becoming the band's last UK Top 20 hit. Multiple artists have covered \"King of Pain\".

Morissette wrote the song and co-produced it with Rob Cavallo. \"Uninvited\" is driven by four piano notes and builds to an instrumental climax, and haunting atmosphere accompanied by cryptic lyrics. Because the song was not released as a physical single in the United States, it was not allowed to chart on the Billboard Hot 100 due to rules in place at the time. It instead appeared on the Hot 100 Airplay chart, peaking at number four in June 1998. In Canada, \"Uninvited\" reached number seven on the RPM 100 Hit Tracks chart. Elsewhere, the single peaked at number one in El Salvador and number six in Iceland. In 1999, the song won two Grammy Awards: Best Female Rock Vocal Performance and Best Rock Song."

The title of the album is taken from a line in the first verse of the song \"You Learn\". Jagged Little Pill received positive reviews from critics, who praised its music and Morissette's lyrics and vocals. It received nine Grammy Award nominations, of which it won five: Album of the Year, making her the youngest artist to win the award at the time; Best Rock Album; Best Female Rock Vocal Performance (\"You Oughta Know\"); Best Rock Song (\"You Oughta Know\"); and Best Long Form Music Video. It was certified ten times platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), seventeen times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and double diamond by Music Canada, making Morissette the first Canadian artist to achieve double diamond. With combined sales of over 33 million copies worldwide, Jagged Little Pill is one of the best-selling albums of all time. It has been included on several all-time lists, such as those of Apple Music, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Rolling Stone. The album has been re-released twice: on October 30, 2015, in a two-disc deluxe edition and a four-disc collector's edition commemorating its 20th anniversary; and on June 26, 2020, in a 25th anniversary deluxe edition. An acoustic re-recording of the album was released on June 13, 2005, to mark its 10th anniversary. It inspired a musical stage production, which premiered at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Massachusetts on May 5, 2018; it transferred to Broadway the following year, and was nominated for 15 Tony Awards, including Best Musical. A world tour celebrating the 25th anniversary of Jagged Little Pill began in early 2020 but was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic."

        "text_description": "\"You Oughta Know\" is a song by Canadian singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette, released as the lead single from her third studio album, Jagged Little Pill, on July 10, 1995. After releasing two studio albums, Morissette left MCA Records Canada and was introduced to manager Scott Welch. Morissette began working on new music after moving from her hometown of Ottawa to Toronto, but made little progress. In Los Angeles, she met producer Glen Ballard, with whom she wrote songs including \"You Oughta Know\". Despite much speculation concerning whom the song is about, Morissette has never disclosed the person's identity and has never indicated an intention to do so. \"You Oughta Know\" signaled Morissette's departure from bubblegum pop to alternative rock, and features guitarist Dave Navarro and bassist Flea of Red Hot Chili Peppers. It outperformed the label's expectations and received positive reviews. After the influential Los Angeles modern rock radio station KROQ-FM began playing it, the single reached the top ten in Canada, Australia and the United States. It was a multiformat hit in several US genre charts, and made the top 40 in Belgium, Iceland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden and the United Kingdom. A music video was directed by Nick Egan. The single was added in the set list for Morissette's 1995 world tour; since then, it has been included in her albums MTV Unplugged (1999), Feast on Scraps (2002), and The Collection, as well as 1997 Grammys and the MTV Unplugged compilation albums. It has received numerous accolades; in 1996, the single was nominated for three Grammy Awards, winning the awards for Best Rock Song and Best Female Rock Vocal Performance. In 2021, the song was listed at #103 in the Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time."

It was the lead single from his tenth studio album, Drive (2002), released on Arista Nashville. The song's lyrics center on reactions to the September 11 attacks in the United States, written in the form of questions. Jackson desired to write a song capturing the emotions surrounding the attacks, but found it difficult to do so. He debuted the song publicly at the Country Music Association's annual awards show on November 7, 2001. It was released that month as a single and topped the Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart for five weeks; in addition, it reached number 28 on Billboard's all-genre Hot 100 chart. The song received largely positive reviews from critics, who appreciated its simple, largely apolitical stance. The song won multiple awards at the Academy of Country Music and Country Music Association Awards, including Song of the Year, and also earned Jackson his first Grammy Award for Best Country Song."

        "text_description": "Steven Patrick Morrissey ( MORR-iss-ee; born 22 May 1959), known mononymously as Morrissey, is an English singer and songwriter. He came to prominence as the frontman and lyricist of rock band the Smiths, who were active from 1982 to 1987. Since then, he has pursued a successful solo career. Morrissey's music is characterised by his baritone voice and distinctive lyrics with recurring themes of emotional isolation, sexual longing, self-deprecating and dark humour, and anti-establishment stances. Morrissey was born to working-class Irish immigrants in Davyhulme, Lancashire, England; the family lived in Queen's Court near the Loreto convent in Hulme and his mother worked nearby at the Hulme Hippodrome bingo hall. They moved due to the 1960s demolitions of almost all the Victorian-era houses in Hulme, known as 'slum clearance', and he grew up in nearby Stretford. As a child, he developed a love of literature, kitchen sink realism, and 1960s pop music. In the late 1970s, he fronted the punk rock band the Nosebleeds with little success before beginning a career in music journalism and writing several books on music and film in the early 1980s. (Morrissey later said, in 2024, that he \"did not ever join\" the Nosebleeds.) He formed the Smiths with Johnny Marr in 1982 and the band soon attracted national recognition for their eponymous debut album. As the band's frontman, Morrissey attracted attention for his trademark quiff and witty and sardonic lyrics. Deliberately avoiding rock machismo, he cultivated the image of a sexually ambiguous social outsider who embraced celibacy. The Smiths released three further studio albums\u2014Meat Is Murder, The Queen Is Dead, and Strangeways, Here We Come\u2014and had a string of hit singles. The band were critically acclaimed and attracted a cult following. Personal differences between Morrissey and Marr resulted in the separation of the Smiths in 1987. In 1988, Morrissey launched his solo career with Viva Hate. This album and its follow-ups\u2014Kill Uncle (1991), Your Arsenal (1992), and Vauxhall and I (1994)\u2014all did well on the UK Albums Chart and spawned multiple hit singles. He took on Alain Whyte and Boz Boorer as his main co-writers to replace Marr. During this time his image began to shift into that of a more robust figure who toyed with patriotic imagery and working-class masculinity. In the mid to late 1990s, his albums Southpaw Grammar (1995) and Maladjusted (1997) also charted but were less well received. Relocating to Los Angeles, he took a musical hiatus from 1998 to 2003 before releasing a successful comeback album, You Are the Quarry, in 2004. Ensuing years saw the release of albums Ringleader of the Tormentors (2006), Years of Refusal (2009), World Peace Is None of Your Business (2014), Low in High School (2017), California Son (2019), and I Am Not a Dog on a Chain (2020), as well as his autobiography (2013) and his debut novel, List of the Lost (2015). Highly influential, Morrissey has been credited as a seminal figure in the emergence of indie pop, indie rock, and Britpop. In a 2006 poll for the BBC's Culture Show, Morrissey was voted the second-greatest living British cultural icon. His work has been the subject of academic study. He has been a controversial figure throughout his music career due to his forthright opinions and outspoken nature, endorsing vegetarianism and animal rights and criticising royalty and prominent politicians. He has also supported far-right activism with regard to British heritage, and defended a particular vision of national identity while critiquing the effects of immigration on the UK."

Likewise, \"King Creole\", the title song to his fourth film (a reference to the name of a nightclub, in the movie), when translated into Spanish by Los Teen Tops, became \"Rey del Rock\", with lyrics which, irrespective that his name was not actually mentioned, went on to explain, in detail, why Presley was given the title of \"King of Rock\"."

Musically, the album is more melodic and accessible than the band's previous work. Up to this album, all Alan Parsons Project albums had been packaged in gatefold sleeves. Increasing budgetary constraints of record companies made The Turn of a Friendly Card the beginning of all subsequently released Alan Parsons Project albums to be single-sleeve packaged.

        "text_description": "\"Good Times\" (aka \"Gonna Have a Good Time\") is a song by the Australian rock band the Easybeats, written by George Young and Harry Vanda. It was released in June 1968 on their album Vigil, and as a single in July 1968 through Parlophone. It features guest vocals by Steve Marriott of Small Faces, and piano by Nicky Hopkins. The original Easybeats recording reached #22 in Australia. When broadcast by BBC radio, it was reportedly heard by Paul McCartney on his car radio; McCartney apparently rang the station immediately to request a repeat playing. The song has been covered by Australian and international artists; in 1987, a version by INXS, featuring Jimmy Barnes, was included on the soundtrack of the film The Lost Boys and was a top 50 Billboard Hot 100 hit in the United States. It was also interpolated by Meat Loaf on his 1995 song \"Runnin' for the Red Light (I Got a Life)\" from his album Welcome to the Neighbourhood."

O'Neal came to prominence in the mid-1980s as a solo artist, with eleven top 40 singles on the US R&B chart, three of which also reached the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100. However, he enjoyed more mainstream success in the United Kingdom, achieving fourteen top 40 singles on the UK Singles Chart between 1985 and 1996, along with three top ten albums on the UK Albums Chart. His solo singles, sometimes dealing with lost love, include \"If You Were Here Tonight\", \"Fake\", \"Criticize\", \"The Lovers\", \"(What Can I Say) To Make You Love Me\", \"All True Man\", \"Love Makes No Sense\" and \"In the Middle\". He is also known for duets with Tabu labelmate Cherrelle such as \"Saturday Love\" and \"Never Knew Love Like This\". AllMusic described O'Neal as having a \"tough voice [that] has the same grain and range as that of Otis Redding.\" O'Neal released his debut album, the eponymous Alexander O'Neal, in 1985. Since then, he has released nine studio albums, six compilation albums and two live albums."

An abbreviated version of that second edition, known as BWV2a, was published in 1998. The catalogue groups compositions by genre. Even within a genre, compositions are not necessarily collated chronologically. For example, BWV 992 was composed many years before BWV 1. BWV numbers were assigned to 1,126 compositions in the 20th century, and more have been added to the catalogue in the 21st century. The Annex of the BWV (BWV Anh.) lists over 200 lost, doubtful and spurious compositions."

This compilation's song versions were remixed by Jack Richardson at the time, with the remix of \"I'm Eighteen\" being released as a single in the US. The reason behind remixing the songs was perhaps to boost its appeal as \"new\" versions because no new tracks were available for inclusion by the group as they were on hiatus at the time. This compilation was expanded upon when, in 2001, Rhino released Mascara & Monsters: The Best of Alice Cooper, which includes the original single versions of the songs in addition to a number of Cooper's post-1974 hits as a solo artist, filling up the entire CD.

The song performed better in the United Kingdom, peaking at number two on the UK Singles Chart. \"Poison\" was ranked by Billboard as the 91st-most-successful song of 1989, while Ultimate Classic Rock ranked it as the \"7th best Alice Cooper song\", commenting \"Poison sounds like a typical '80s pop-metal number at times, but Cooper\u2019s intensity brings it to a whole other level.\" The song's main riff was written by guitarist John McCurry, who two years earlier had used it for the John Waite track \"Encircled\"."

It was the band's last album recorded with all four original members, as bassist Mike Starr was fired in January 1993 during the tour to support the album. The majority of the songs were written by guitarist Jerry Cantrell, but for the first time, vocalist Layne Staley wrote two songs by himself (\"Hate to Feel\" and \"Angry Chair\"), both also featuring Staley on guitar. The track \"Iron Gland\" features Tom Araya from Slayer on vocals. The album's lyrics explore depression, pain, anger, anti-social behavior, relationships, drug addiction (primarily heroin), war, death, and other emotionally charged topics. Dirt received critical acclaim upon release and peaked at No. 6 on the Billboard 200 chart. It has since been certified 5\u00d7 Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), making Dirt the band's highest selling album to date. The album spawned five singles: \"Would?\", \"Them Bones\", \"Angry Chair\", \"Rooster\", and \"Down in a Hole\", all with accompanying music videos. Dirt was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance. The music video for \"Would?\" was nominated for an MTV Video Music Award for Best Video from a Film, as the song was featured on the soundtrack to Cameron Crowe's 1992 film Singles. It was voted \"Kerrang! Critic's Choice Album of the Year\" and Guitar World named Dirt the best guitar album of 1992. It was included in the 2005 book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. Loudwire named it as one of the best metal albums of the 1990s, and Rolling Stone ranked it No. 26 on its list of the \"100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time\" in 2017, as well as at No. 6 on its list of the \"50 Greatest Grunge Albums\" in 2019."

        "text_description": "Bob Dylan (legally Robert Dylan; born Robert Allen Zimmerman, May 24, 1941) is an American singer-songwriter. Described as one of the greatest songwriters of all time, Dylan has been a major figure in popular culture over his nearly 70-year career. With an estimated more than 125 million records sold worldwide, he is one of the best-selling musicians of all time. Dylan added increasingly sophisticated lyrical techniques to the folk music of the early 1960s, infusing it \"with the intellectualism of classic literature and poetry\". His lyrics incorporated political, social, and philosophical influences, defying pop music conventions and appealing to the burgeoning counterculture. Dylan was born in St. Louis County, Minnesota. He moved to New York City in 1961 to pursue a career in music. Following his 1962 debut album, Bob Dylan, featuring traditional folk and blues material, he released his breakthrough album The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan (1963), which included \"Girl from the North Country\" and \"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\", adapting older folk songs. His songs \"Blowin' in the Wind\" (1963) and \"The Times They Are a-Changin'\" (1964) became anthems for the civil rights and antiwar movements. In 1965 and 1966, Dylan created controversy among folk purists when he used electrically amplified rock instrumentation for his albums Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited (both 1965), and Blonde on Blonde (1966). His six-minute single \"Like a Rolling Stone\" (1965) expanded commercial and creative boundaries in popular music. In July 1966, a motorcycle crash led Dylan to cease touring for seven years. During this period, he recorded a large body of songs with members of the Band which produced the album The Basement Tapes (1975). Dylan explored country music and rural themes on the albums John Wesley Harding (1967), Nashville Skyline (1969) and New Morning (1970). He gained critical attention for Blood on the Tracks (1975), and Time Out of Mind (1997), the latter of which earned him the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. Dylan still releases music and has toured continuously since the late 1980s on what has become known as the Never Ending Tour. Since 1994, Dylan has published nine books of paintings and drawings, and his work has been exhibited in major art galleries. His life has been profiled in several documentaries and the biopic A Complete Unknown (2024). Dylan's numerous accolades include an Academy Award, ten Grammy Awards and a Golden Globe Award. He was honored with the Kennedy Center Honors in 1997, National Medal of Arts in 2009, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2012. Dylan has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame. He was awarded a Pulitzer Prize special citation in 2008, and the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature \"for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition\"."

        "text_description": "Alice in Chains (sometimes informally referred to as the Dog Album or Tripod) is the third studio album by American rock band Alice in Chains. It was released on October 31, 1995, by Columbia Records, and was the full-length follow-up to the group's commercial breakthrough Dirt (1992). This is the band's first studio album to feature bassist Mike Inez, their last to feature original lead vocalist Layne Staley, and their final studio album to be released through Columbia. For a year and a half, Alice in Chains did not play any live shows due to Staley's health issues. In the meantime, Staley joined supergroup Mad Season and recorded the album Above (1995), leaving the future of Alice in Chains in question. In addition, Staley's growing heroin addiction led to growing rumors of his death. Shortly after the release of Above, Alice in Chains set out to create their third album, with the intention of putting an end to the gossip surrounding the band. Recorded at Seattle's Bad Animals Studio with Toby Wright, the album's songs focus on heavy emotional content and subject matter such as drug addiction, depression, spirituality, broken relationships, and the internal tensions within the band that were being fueled by Staley's substance abuse. The album's music relies less on heavy metal riffs and more on melody and texturally varied arrangements, some integrating some of the acoustic moods of their EPs, and others introducing late 1960s and early 1970s rock influences. Alice in Chains was released in the twilight of the grunge era. The band remained largely unable to tour for the album due to Staley's addiction, performing live only on televised events and opening for Kiss. Nevertheless, the album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart and stayed on the chart for nearly a year. The tracks \"Grind\", \"Heaven Beside You\", and \"Again\" were released as singles. \"Grind\" and \"Again\" were nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance. The album was certified double platinum by the RIAA and has sold over three million copies worldwide. The album was the band's last for almost 14 years; Staley died from a drug overdose in 2002, which caused the band to dissolve. The band eventually emerged with Black Gives Way to Blue in 2009 with new co-vocalist William DuVall."

It was written by Jackson and produced by Jackson and Quincy Jones. The lyrics describe a woman who has been attacked in her apartment by a \"smooth criminal\". The music video for \"Smooth Criminal\", which premiered internationally on MTV on October 13, 1988, is the centerpiece of the 1988 film Moonwalker. The 1930s setting and Jackson's white suit and fedora pay tribute to the Fred Astaire musical comedy film The Band Wagon. In the video, Jackson and the dancers perform an apparently physically impossible \"anti-gravity lean\". \"Smooth Criminal\" reached number seven on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the sixth top-10 single from Bad. It reached number two on the Billboard Hot Black Singles chart. It was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It reached number one in Belgium, Iceland, the Netherlands, and Spain. Retrospective reviews have praised \"Smooth Criminal\" as a standout track on Bad and one of Jackson's best songs. Rolling Stone wrote that it was \"his best blend of R&B groove and rock edginess, and a turning point in his shift toward darker, harder-edged material\". It has appeared on numerous greatest hits albums and was performed on all of Jackson's solo tours. \"Smooth Criminal\" was re-released in 2006 as a single as a part of Jackson's Visionary: The Video Singles boxset. In 2001, a version by Alien Ant Farm became an international hit."

        "text_description": "Rafael Le\u00f3nidas Trujillo Molina ( troo-HEE-yoh; Spanish: [rafa\u02c8el le\u02c8oni\u00f0as t\u027eu\u02c8xi\u029do mo\u02c8lina]; 24 October 1891 \u2013 30 May 1961), nicknamed El Jefe (Spanish: [el \u02c8xefe]; \"the boss\"), was a Dominican military officer and dictator who ruled the Dominican Republic from August 1930 until his assassination in May 1961. He served as the 36th and 39th president from 1930 to 1938 and again from 1942 to 1952. He also served as the first generalissimo, the de facto most powerful position in the country at the time from 1930 until his assassination. Under that position, Trujillo served under figurehead presidents. Trujillo's 31-year rule, the Trujillo Era (Spanish: El Trujillato or La Era de Trujillo), was one of the longest for a non-royal leader in the world, and centered around a personality cult of the ruling family. It was also one of the most brutal; Trujillo's security forces, including the infamous SIM, were responsible for perhaps as many as 50,000 murders. These included between 17,000 and 35,000 Haitians in the infamous Parsley massacre in 1937, which continues to affect Dominican-Haitian relations to this day. During his long rule, the Trujillo government's extensive use of state terrorism was prolific even beyond national borders, including the attempted assassination of Venezuelan president R\u00f3mulo Betancourt in 1960, the abduction and disappearance in New York City of the Basque exile Jes\u00fas Gal\u00edndez in 1956, and the murder of Spanish writer Jos\u00e9 Almoina in Mexico, also in 1960. These acts, particularly the presumed murder of Gal\u00edndez, a naturalized US citizen, the attempted murder of Betancourt, a staunch critic of Trujillo, and the murder of the Mirabal sisters, who were among his most notable opponents, in 1960, eroded relations between the Dominican Republic and the international community and ushered in OAS sanctions and economic and military assistance to Dominican opposition forces. After this momentous year, large segments of the Dominican establishment, including the military, turned against him. On 30 May 1961, Trujillo was assassinated by a group of conspirators led by general Antonio Imbert Barrera. In the immediate aftermath, Trujillo's son Ramfis took temporary control of the country, executing most of the conspirators. By November 1961, the Trujillo family was pressured into exile by the titular president Joaqu\u00edn Balaguer, who introduced reforms to open up the regime. The murder ushered in civil strife which concluded with the Dominican Civil War and a US-OAS intervention, eventually stabilised under a multi-party system in 1966. The Trujillo era unfolded in a Hispanic Caribbean environment particularly susceptible to dictators. In the countries of the Caribbean Basin alone, his dictatorship overlapped with those in Cuba, Nicaragua, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Venezuela and Haiti. In perspective, the Trujillo dictatorship has been judged more prominent and more brutal than its contemporaries. Trujillo remains a polarizing figure in the Dominican Republic, as the sheer longevity of his rule makes a detached evaluation difficult. While his supporters credit him for bringing long-term stability, economic growth and prosperity, doubling life expectancy of average Dominicans and multiplying the GDP, critics denounce the heavy-handed and violent nature of his regime, including the murder of tens of thousands, and xenophobia towards Haitians, as well as the Trujillo family's nepotism, widespread corruption and looting of the country's natural and economic resources."

Released in 1983, it was initially a stand-alone single but was subsequently included on their self-titled second album a year later. The song reached number eight on the UK Singles Chart in 1983 and the group appeared on the BBC's Top of the Pops that summer (July 1983), and after its inclusion in the 1984 film The Karate Kid, it reached number nine on the US Billboard Hot 100. Bananarama singer Sara Dallin said the song \"played on the darker side (of summer songs): it looked at the oppressive heat, the misery of wanting to be with someone as the summer ticked by. We've all been there!\" It was ranked number 44 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of the '80s. Billboard named the song number 13 on their list of the \"100 Greatest Girl Group Songs of All Time\"."

The track was produced by William Orbit, and written by Tom Nichols, Alexander von Soos and Kirsty Bertarelli (credited as Kirsty Elizabeth), initially intended as a single for Kirsty under the title \"I Wouldn't Wanna Be\". It is a mellow electropop, acid techno and R&B song, unique for its production-laden sound featuring breathy keyboards, glitching electronics and elements of ambient music. A wistful love song, its lyrics stem from Kirsty's relationship with Swiss entrepreneur Ernesto Bertarelli, detailing feelings of love at first sight and contentment. The track was met with general acclaim from music critics who likened it to the group's previous single \"Pure Shores\" for their wistful chorus delivery and Orbit's distinctive production. Its unconventional structure was also cited as influential upon the sound of later girl groups such as the Sugababes and Girls Aloud. A commercial success, \"Black Coffee\" marked All Saints' fifth and final number-one single in the UK. It also reached the top 10 in Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Sweden. Bo Johan Renck directed the accompanying music video which features the group serenading an arguing couple in bullet time in a high rise apartment block. All Saints promoted \"Black Coffee\" with live performances on CD:UK, Children in Need, Later... with Jools Holland, Top of the Pops and at the 2000 Smash Hits Poll Winners Party. Much group in-fighting happened during the promotion of the single, prompting tense live renditions and eventually causing the group to split up in 2001, acrimoniously."

The album features guest appearances from Teezo Touchdown, 21 Savage, J. Cole, Yeat, SZA, PartyNextDoor, Chief Keef, Bad Bunny, Sexyy Red, and Lil Yachty. Production was handled by Drake, Teezo Touchdown, and Lil Yachty themselves, along with 40, Sango, Oz, Bnyx, Southside, Boi-1da, Vinylz, Tay Keith, FnZ, Jahaan Sweet, the late DJ Screw, Stwo, Gordo, Justin Raisen, and the Alchemist, among others. Drake first teased For All the Dogs in January 2023, and developed it mostly during the It's All a Blur Tour. Originally set for release in September 2023, the album was delayed several times and follows both of his albums released in 2022: his seventh album, Honestly, Nevermind, and his collaborative album with 21 Savage, Her Loss. For All the Dogs was supported by five singles: \"Slime You Out\", \"8AM in Charlotte\", \"Rich Baby Daddy\", \"First Person Shooter\", and \"You Broke My Heart\", with the latter appearing on the Scary Hours deluxe edition of the album. Upon the album's release, critical reception was mixed, with praise for its production but criticism for its length and some of its lyrics. For All the Dogs ended up on year-end lists by several publications as one of the best albums of the year. The album set various regional and global sales records. In the United States, it opened with first-week sales of 402,000 album-equivalent units and topped the Billboard 200 chart, becoming the year's highest-selling rap album. It also earned 514.01 million global on-demand streams in the debut week, which was the largest streaming week of 2023."

Vocalist Anthony Kiedis wrote the lyrics while reflecting on loneliness and the struggles of being clean from drugs, and almost did not share it with the band. \"Under the Bridge\" was praised by critics and fans for its emotional weight. The song was a commercial success and the band's highest-charting single, peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100, number one on the Cash Box Top 100 and certified platinum. It was also a success in other countries, mostly charting within the top 10. Gus Van Sant directed the song's music video, which was filmed in Los Angeles. \"Under the Bridge\" helped the Red Hot Chili Peppers enter the mainstream. David Fricke of Rolling Stone said that the song \"unexpectedly drop-kicked the band into the Top 10\". The song has become an inspiration to other artists, and remains a seminal component of the alternative rock movement of the early-to-mid 1990s. In April 1998, English girl group All Saints released a cover version that topped the UK Singles Chart for two weeks in May 1998."

        "text_description": "Rudolf Greinz (August 16, 1866 \u2013 August 16, 1942) was an Austrian writer. He was born as the eldest of five children of Anton Greinz and his wife Maria (n\u00e9e Kapferer). His younger brothers Hugo (1873\u20131946) and Hermann (1879\u20131938) were also writers. In 1879 the family moved to Salzburg; his father had been transferred there. In 1883 Rudolf Greinz laid on the k.k. State Gymnasium in Salzburg from the Matura. He then studied German language and literature, Classical Philology and art history at the Universities of Graz and Innsbruck. Due to illness, Greinz had to give up his intended scientific career and decided to become a writer. As a freelance writer he settled in Merano. In Meran, Rudolf Greinz met Zoe Basevi, a native of a significant Jewish-British family, the daughter of a retired naval officer living there, a grandniece of the English statesman Benjamin Disraeli. They married in 1899. In 1905 he moved with his family to Innsbruck. There he worked on the magazine Der F\u00f6hn, together with Richard Wilhelm Polifka, Rudolf Brix and Franz Kranewitter. His contributions, however, increasingly met with criticism and rejection of his fellow writers, which is why he relocated to Munich in 1911. There he worked under the pseudonym \"Tuifelemaler Kassian Kluibensch\u00e4del\" at the magazine Jugend. In 1934 his wife Zoe died. Two years later, Rudolf Greinz moved to Ansitz Rosenegg in Aldrans, a village above Innsbruck. He acquired the \"Villa Rosenegg\" in 1926, but initially used it only as a summer resort. Numerous travels took him to poetry readings throughout the German-speaking world. In 1939 Greinz submitted his application for admission to the Reichsschrifttumskammer, which was retroactively granted on July 1, 1938. Rudolf Greinz died on his 76th birthday. His tomb is located in the cemetery in Ampass."

As with the first 3 seasons, shorter edits of the recording were used for the opening and closing credits. There were two versions of this song. One has a saxophone and the other has a harmonica."

        "text_description": "\"You Made Me Love You (I Didn't Want to Do It)\" is a popular song from 1913 composed by James V. Monaco with lyrics by Joseph McCarthy. It was introduced by Al Jolson in the Broadway revue The Honeymoon Express (1913), and used in the 1973 revival of the musical Irene. One of the earliest singers to record the song was Al Jolson. His rendition was recorded on June 4, 1913. It was released as Columbia A-1374 and was an international hit. In Britain, Columbia had to order 25,000 copies from the U.S. to satisfy unprecedented demand for a gramophone record. American performers working in West End shows, like Grace La Rue and Willie Solar, quickly recorded versions there to capitalize on the phenomenon. Another successful recording in 1913 was by William J. Halley. Al Jolson recorded the song again on March 20, 1946, released as Decca 23613. Jolson also performed the song for the soundtrack of the 1946 film The Jolson Story. In 1937, Roger Edens wrote additional lyrics to the song for Judy Garland. The new lyrics cast Garland in the role of a teenage fan of Clark Gable. Garland sang the song to Gable at a birthday party thrown for him by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). MGM executives were so charmed by her rendition that she and the song were added to the film Broadway Melody of 1938. Garland recorded the \"Gable\" version on September 24, 1937. It was released as Decca 1463. MGM released the song as a B-side in 1939, opposite Garland's recording of \"Over the Rainbow\" from The Wizard of Oz."

        "text_description": "Alastair Ian Stewart (born 5 September 1945) is a Scottish-born singer-songwriter and folk-rock musician who rose to prominence as part of the British folk revival in the 1960s and 1970s. He developed a unique style of combining folk-rock songs with tales of characters and events from history. Stewart has released 16 studio and four live albums since his debut album Bed-Sitter Images in 1967, and continues to tour extensively in the US, Canada, Europe, and the UK. He is best known for his 1976 hit single \"Year of the Cat\", from the platinum album of the same name. Though Year of the Cat and its 1978 platinum follow-up Time Passages brought Stewart his biggest worldwide commercial successes, earlier albums such as Past, Present and Future from 1973 are often seen as better examples of his intimate brand of historical folk-rock, a style to which he returned in later albums. His 2009 release, Uncorked, was released on his independent label, Wallaby Trails Recordings, and was followed up by Al Stewart and The Empty Pockets Live in 2024. Stewart has worked with Peter White, Alan Parsons, Jimmy Page, Richard Thompson, Rick Wakeman, Francis Monkman, Tori Amos, and Tim Renwick, and more recently has played with Dave Nachmanoff and former Wings lead-guitarist Laurence Juber. Stewart appears throughout the musical history of the folk revivalist era. He played at the initial Glastonbury Festival in 1970, knew Yoko Ono before she met John Lennon, shared a London flat with Paul Simon (who was collaborating with Bruce Woodley of the Seekers), and hosted at the Les Cousins folk club in London in the 1960s."

        "text_description": "\"Daisy Jane\" is a song written by Gerry Beckley of the band America, included on the band's 1975 album Hearts. Issued as that album's second single \u2014 following up the #1 hit \"Sister Golden Hair\" \u2014 \"Daisy Jane\" reached #20 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the final Top 20 hit by the original three-member incarnation of America. On the Easy Listening chart the track reached #4. In Canada, the chart peak of \"Daisy Jane\" was #16 on the Pop singles chart and #2 on the Adult Contemporary chart. The song's narrator indicates he's flying back to Memphis in hopes of reconnecting with the girl he left behind \"to roam the city\". Beckley, who wrote the song at his cottage in East Sussex, has stated: \"There was no such person as Daisy Jane and I had never even been to Memphis\": Beckley believes that he likely drew the idea of writing a song entitled \"Daisy Jane\" from the Nick Drake song \"Hazey Jane\". Cash Box called it \"a tender rock ballad with George Martin\u2019s brilliant piano and string work in abundant evidence.\" Record World said that \"the trio has never been hotter \u2013 nor smoother, for that matter.\" The song features a solo cello. Producer George Martin played the piano on the song. A Finnish rendering which retains the title \"Daisy Jane\" was recorded by Reijo Karvonen for his 1975 album Tulossa. The Janet Jackson track \"Let's Wait Awhile\" from her 1986 album Control has been described as \"bear[ing] striking similarities\" to \"Daisy Jane\". Reportedly on hearing \"Let's Wait Awhile\" on a car radio in 1987 - the track then being a current single - the road manager for the group America pulled over at a phone booth to alert Gerry Beckley to the evident debt of Jackson's track to Beckley's composition: eventually Beckley reached an out-of-court settlement with Jackson and her co-writers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis thus preempting litigation for plagiarism. (The 2001 Janet Jackson album All for You featured the track \"Someone to Call My Lover\" which overtly sampled the America hit \"Ventura Highway\" whose composer Dewey Bunnell received a co-write credit for Jackson's song.)"

        "text_description": "Tori Amos (born Myra Ellen Amos; August 22, 1963) is an American singer-songwriter and pianist. She is a classically trained musician with a mezzo-soprano vocal range. Having already begun composing instrumental pieces on piano, Amos won a full scholarship to the Peabody Institute at Johns Hopkins University at the age of five, the youngest person ever to have been admitted. She had to leave at the age of eleven when her scholarship was discontinued for what Rolling Stone described as \"musical insubordination\". Amos was the lead singer of the short-lived 1980s pop-rock group Y Kant Tori Read before achieving her breakthrough as a solo artist in the early 1990s. Her songs focus on a broad range of topics, including sexuality, feminism, politics, and religion. Her charting singles include \"Crucify\", \"Silent All These Years\", \"God\", \"Cornflake Girl\", \"Caught a Lite Sneeze\", \"Professional Widow\", \"Spark\", \"1000 Oceans\", \"Flavor\" and \"A Sorta Fairytale\". Amos has received five MTV VMA nominations and eight Grammy Award nominations, and won an Echo Klassik award for her Night of Hunters classical crossover album. She is listed on VH1's 1999 \"100 Greatest Women of Rock and Roll\" at number 71."

The song was selected as the winning song in a contest for the Baltimore Orioles and was recorded and pressed locally as a 7\" single. From 1984 to 1989, Amos fronted the synth-pop band Y Kant Tori Read, which released one self-titled album with Atlantic Records in 1988 before breaking up. Shortly thereafter, Amos began writing and recording material that would serve as the debut of her solo career. Still signed with Atlantic, and its UK counterpart East West, Amos' initial solo material was rejected by the label in 1990. Under the guidance of co-producers Eric Rosse, Davitt Sigerson and Ian Stanley, a second version of the album was created and accepted by the label the following year. Amos' solo career began in October 1991 with the UK release of the Me and a Gun EP. The following month, after the first track on the EP was receiving more airplay than the title track, the label reissued the EP with the same artwork, but changed the title to Silent All These Years. Although the second version of the EP reached only number 51 on the UK chart, BBC Radio 1 picked it as \"Record of the Week\", which helped Amos get her initial exposure. Her debut solo album, Little Earthquakes, was released two months later in January 1992. The album peaked at number 14 on the Australian and UK Albums Chart and at number 54 on the Billboard 200. Upon its release, the album received mostly positive reviews and was labeled an important album that kick-started the female singer-songwriter movement of the 1990s. Despite reaching only number 54 on the Billboard 200, Little Earthquakes was a mainstay on the chart for 38 weeks and remains Amos' highest-selling album in the United States. Subsequent albums with Atlantic were released at approximately two-year intervals. Amos' sophomore effort, Under the Pink, co-produced with Eric Rosse, debuted in February 1994 at number 12 on the Billboard 200 and number 1 on the UK Albums Chart. Boys for Pele, Amos' third solo album and the first album that was self-produced, debuted in January 1996 at number 2 on both the US and UK charts, making it her highest simultaneous trans-Atlantic debut. From the Choirgirl Hotel, Amos' first album written and recorded with bandmates Matt Chamberlain on drums, Jon Evans on bass and Steve Caton on guitar, and her first album recorded at her in-home recording studio, Martian Engineering, debuted in May 1998 at number 5 on the Billboard 200 and at number 6 on the UK Albums Chart. The following year, To Venus and Back, a double album of studio and live material recorded with Chamberlain, Evans and Caton, debuted in September 1999 at number 12 in the US and at number 22 in the UK. In September 2001, Strange Little Girls, a covers album recorded with Chamberlin on drums, Evans and Justin Meldal-Johnsen on bass and Adrian Belew on guitar, debuted at number 4 on the Billboard 200 and at number 16 on the UK Albums Chart. Due to professional conflicts, after working with Atlantic for the first 15 years of her career, Amos decided to seek another label. She joined Epic Records and released three albums over the next five years: Scarlet's Walk in October 2002, The Beekeeper in February 2005 and American Doll Posse in May 2007. On all three albums, Amos performed with Chamberlin on drums, Evans on bass and Mac Aladdin on guitar. Each album debuted in the Top 10 of the Billboard 200, placing Amos in an elite group of women who have secured five or more Top 10 album debuts. Amos negotiated an end to her contract with Epic following the release of American Doll Posse, announcing in 2008 that she will be operating independently of record labels. In early 2009, Amos signed a distribution, or joint-venture, deal with Universal Republic Records, a division of Universal Music Group, which granted her greater creative control over her work than traditional recording contracts. Amos released two albums her first year under the contract: Abnormally Attracted to Sin in May 2009 and the seasonal album Midwinter Graces, featuring reworked Christmas carols and some original songs, in November 2009. Abnormally Attracted to Sin is Amos's seventh album to debut on the US Top 10 on the Billboard 200. Amos followed up with her first classical music album, Night of Hunters, recorded with Andreas Ottensamer of the Berlin Philharmonic and the award-winning string quartet, Apollon Musag\u00e8te. Night of Hunters was released in September 2011, through the Deutsche Grammophon label, the classical music division of Universal Music Group. With Night of Hunters, Amos made Billboard history by being the first female artist to have an album place in the Top 10 of the Classical, Alternative, and Rock charts simultaneously. To date in her solo career, Amos has recorded and released a total of 16 solo studio albums, multiple live releases, three compilation albums, one of which is a five-disc box set released through Rhino Entertainment, and numerous singles and EPs. Amos has contributed to numerous film soundtracks as well."

Having already begun composing instrumental pieces on piano, Amos won a full scholarship to the Peabody Institute at Johns Hopkins University at the age of five, the youngest person ever to have been admitted. She had to leave at the age of eleven when her scholarship was discontinued for what Rolling Stone described as \"musical insubordination\". Amos was the lead singer of the short-lived 1980s pop-rock group Y Kant Tori Read before achieving her breakthrough as a solo artist in the early 1990s. Her songs focus on a broad range of topics, including sexuality, feminism, politics, and religion. Her charting singles include \"Crucify\", \"Silent All These Years\", \"God\", \"Cornflake Girl\", \"Caught a Lite Sneeze\", \"Professional Widow\", \"Spark\", \"1000 Oceans\", \"Flavor\" and \"A Sorta Fairytale\". Amos has received five MTV VMA nominations and eight Grammy Award nominations, and won an Echo Klassik award for her Night of Hunters classical crossover album. She is listed on VH1's 1999 \"100 Greatest Women of Rock and Roll\" at number 71."

        "text_description": "Tori Amos is an American pianist and singer-songwriter whose musical career began in 1980, at the age of seventeen, when she and her brother co-wrote the song \"Baltimore\". The song was selected as the winning song in a contest for the Baltimore Orioles and was recorded and pressed locally as a 7\" single. From 1984 to 1989, Amos fronted the synth-pop band Y Kant Tori Read, which released one self-titled album with Atlantic Records in 1988 before breaking up. Shortly thereafter, Amos began writing and recording material that would serve as the debut of her solo career. Still signed with Atlantic, and its UK counterpart East West, Amos' initial solo material was rejected by the label in 1990. Under the guidance of co-producers Eric Rosse, Davitt Sigerson and Ian Stanley, a second version of the album was created and accepted by the label the following year. Amos' solo career began in October 1991 with the UK release of the Me and a Gun EP. The following month, after the first track on the EP was receiving more airplay than the title track, the label reissued the EP with the same artwork, but changed the title to Silent All These Years. Although the second version of the EP reached only number 51 on the UK chart, BBC Radio 1 picked it as \"Record of the Week\", which helped Amos get her initial exposure. Her debut solo album, Little Earthquakes, was released two months later in January 1992. The album peaked at number 14 on the Australian and UK Albums Chart and at number 54 on the Billboard 200. Upon its release, the album received mostly positive reviews and was labeled an important album that kick-started the female singer-songwriter movement of the 1990s. Despite reaching only number 54 on the Billboard 200, Little Earthquakes was a mainstay on the chart for 38 weeks and remains Amos' highest-selling album in the United States. Subsequent albums with Atlantic were released at approximately two-year intervals. Amos' sophomore effort, Under the Pink, co-produced with Eric Rosse, debuted in February 1994 at number 12 on the Billboard 200 and number 1 on the UK Albums Chart. Boys for Pele, Amos' third solo album and the first album that was self-produced, debuted in January 1996 at number 2 on both the US and UK charts, making it her highest simultaneous trans-Atlantic debut. From the Choirgirl Hotel, Amos' first album written and recorded with bandmates Matt Chamberlain on drums, Jon Evans on bass and Steve Caton on guitar, and her first album recorded at her in-home recording studio, Martian Engineering, debuted in May 1998 at number 5 on the Billboard 200 and at number 6 on the UK Albums Chart. The following year, To Venus and Back, a double album of studio and live material recorded with Chamberlain, Evans and Caton, debuted in September 1999 at number 12 in the US and at number 22 in the UK. In September 2001, Strange Little Girls, a covers album recorded with Chamberlin on drums, Evans and Justin Meldal-Johnsen on bass and Adrian Belew on guitar, debuted at number 4 on the Billboard 200 and at number 16 on the UK Albums Chart. Due to professional conflicts, after working with Atlantic for the first 15 years of her career, Amos decided to seek another label. She joined Epic Records and released three albums over the next five years: Scarlet's Walk in October 2002, The Beekeeper in February 2005 and American Doll Posse in May 2007. On all three albums, Amos performed with Chamberlin on drums, Evans on bass and Mac Aladdin on guitar. Each album debuted in the Top 10 of the Billboard 200, placing Amos in an elite group of women who have secured five or more Top 10 album debuts. Amos negotiated an end to her contract with Epic following the release of American Doll Posse, announcing in 2008 that she will be operating independently of record labels. In early 2009, Amos signed a distribution, or joint-venture, deal with Universal Republic Records, a division of Universal Music Group, which granted her greater creative control over her work than traditional recording contracts. Amos released two albums her first year under the contract: Abnormally Attracted to Sin in May 2009 and the seasonal album Midwinter Graces, featuring reworked Christmas carols and some original songs, in November 2009. Abnormally Attracted to Sin is Amos's seventh album to debut on the US Top 10 on the Billboard 200. Amos followed up with her first classical music album, Night of Hunters, recorded with Andreas Ottensamer of the Berlin Philharmonic and the award-winning string quartet, Apollon Musag\u00e8te. Night of Hunters was released in September 2011, through the Deutsche Grammophon label, the classical music division of Universal Music Group.

The album was Amos's first to be recorded at her own Martian Engineering Studios in Cornwall, England and was self produced, with the mixing being handled by longtime collaborators Marcel van Limbeek and Mark Hawley, whom she had married in early 1998. In contrast with the sparse, minimalist sound of Amos's previous albums, From the Choirgirl Hotel features a greater emphasis on full band arrangements. Additionally, the album sees Amos integrate elements of electronica, trip hop, and dance music. The album marks the first appearance of Matt Chamberlain on drums; he has gone on to contribute to the majority of Amos's albums ever since. From the Choirgirl Hotel was commercially and critically successful. It peaked at number 5 in the US, becoming Amos's second straight top ten album in her home country, and reached number 6 in the UK. \"Spark\", the album's lead single, reached number 49 on the Billboard Hot 100, her highest position on the chart. Two further singles\u2014\"Jackie's Strength\" and \"Raspberry Swirl\" / \"Cruel\"\u2014were released, with the former reaching the top of the US Hot Dance Club Play chart. The album garnered two Grammy nominations \u2013 one for Best Alternative Music Performance, and another for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance (for \"Raspberry Swirl\"). Amos promoted the album with the \"Plugged '98\" tour, her first with a full band. Performances from the tour were included on the live disc of her next release, To Venus and Back."

        "text_description": "\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" is a song by the American rock band Nirvana. It is the opening track and lead single from the band's second album, Nevermind (1991), released on DGC Records. Having sold over 13 million units worldwide, it is one of the best-selling songs of all time. The success propelled Nevermind to the top of several albums charts and is often marked as the point when grunge entered the mainstream. It was Nirvana's biggest hit, charting high on music industry charts around the world in 1991 and 1992, and was number one on the charts in Belgium, France, New Zealand and Spain. The guitarist and singer, Kurt Cobain, described \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" as an attempt to write \"the ultimate pop song\", inspired by the soft-and-loud dynamics of the Pixies. The title derives from a phrase written by his friend Kathleen Hanna, the singer of the riot grrrl band Bikini Kill: \"Kurt smells like Teen Spirit.\" Hanna was referencing the deodorant Teen Spirit, but Cobain misinterpreted it as a revolutionary slogan. The music video depicts a high school pep rally which ends in chaos, inspired by Jonathan Kaplan's 1979 film Over the Edge and the Ramones' film Rock 'n' Roll High School. It won two MTV Video Music Awards, and was in heavy rotation on MTV during the 1990s. Amy Finnerty, formerly of MTV's programming department, said the video \"changed the entire look of MTV\" by giving the channel \"a whole new generation to sell to\". In 2000, the Guinness World Records named \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" the most played video on MTV Europe. \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" was met with acclaim and described as an \"anthem for apathetic kids\" of Generation X. It was included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's list of \"The Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\". In 2001, the Recording Industry Association of America ranked it number 80 on their Songs of the Century list. In 2002, NME named it the second-greatest single, and in 2013 Kerrang! ranked it the greatest. In 2021, Rolling Stone ranked \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" fifth on its list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. In 2017, it was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame."

It was written by Michael Card and John Thompson, using direct quotes from scripture as their inspiration, and recorded by Card on his 1981 debut album, Legacy. However, the best known version of the song was by singer Amy Grant, whose rendition was recorded in 1982 on her platinum-certified album Age to Age. The title comes from a Judaic name of God, usually translated as \"God Almighty\" (see El Shaddai). Approximately half the lyrics of the chorus are in the Hebrew language, which is rather unusual for a contemporary Christian song. The recording was in the style of a performance ballad, but the song was subsequently published in some hymnbooks and is occasionally sung congregationally. The song was a hit single for Grant, reaching the top ten of the Christian radio chart. \"El Shaddai\" won \"Song of the Year\" and Card won \"Songwriter of the Year\" at the 1983 GMA Dove Awards. It was also named one of the \"Songs of the Century\" by the RIAA in 2001. Grant has recorded at least three different studio versions and one partial version: The original Age to Age version is primarily performed on piano, with harp and string accompaniment. Drums do not appear in this version until the climactic third chorus. This is the version used on most compilations. Grant also incorporated a portion of the song (similar to the Age to Age rendition, but slightly more uptempo) into her Ageless Medley promo release. The medley was named for the Age to Age album, which in turn took its name from the lyrics of \"El Shaddai\". Before releasing her album Behind the Eyes in 1997, Grant released a CD single of \"Takes a Little Time\"; the B-side was a newly recorded version of \"El Shaddai\". This version is notable for the prominent violin accompaniment used throughout the recording. This recording has never been made available on any album or compilation. Grant recorded another new version of the song for her 2005 album Rock of Ages...Hymns and Faith. This version is more in a light pop style, with acoustic guitar and drums throughout, and features harmony vocals and acoustic guitar solo by Grant's husband, Vince Gill. This version is included in the WOW Worship: Aqua compilation, and Grant's 2015 compilation album Be Still and Know... Hymns & Faith. \"El Shaddai\" has been covered by many contemporary Christian and gospel recording artists, including Pat Boone, Winans Phase 2, and Eden's Bridge. Michael Card re-recorded the song for his 1994 compilation, Joy in the Journey. There also exist translated versions which combine Hebrew with other languages."

Approximately half the lyrics of the chorus are in the Hebrew language, which is rather unusual for a contemporary Christian song. The recording was in the style of a performance ballad, but the song was subsequently published in some hymnbooks and is occasionally sung congregationally. The song was a hit single for Grant, reaching the top ten of the Christian radio chart. \"El Shaddai\" won \"Song of the Year\" and Card won \"Songwriter of the Year\" at the 1983 GMA Dove Awards. It was also named one of the \"Songs of the Century\" by the RIAA in 2001. Grant has recorded at least three different studio versions and one partial version: The original Age to Age version is primarily performed on piano, with harp and string accompaniment. Drums do not appear in this version until the climactic third chorus. This is the version used on most compilations. Grant also incorporated a portion of the song (similar to the Age to Age rendition, but slightly more uptempo) into her Ageless Medley promo release. The medley was named for the Age to Age album, which in turn took its name from the lyrics of \"El Shaddai\". Before releasing her album Behind the Eyes in 1997, Grant released a CD single of \"Takes a Little Time\"; the B-side was a newly recorded version of \"El Shaddai\". This version is notable for the prominent violin accompaniment used throughout the recording. This recording has never been made available on any album or compilation. Grant recorded another new version of the song for her 2005 album Rock of Ages...Hymns and Faith. This version is more in a light pop style, with acoustic guitar and drums throughout, and features harmony vocals and acoustic guitar solo by Grant's husband, Vince Gill. This version is included in the WOW Worship: Aqua compilation, and Grant's 2015 compilation album Be Still and Know... Hymns & Faith. \"El Shaddai\" has been covered by many contemporary Christian and gospel recording artists, including Pat Boone, Winans Phase 2, and Eden's Bridge. Michael Card re-recorded the song for his 1994 compilation, Joy in the Journey. There also exist translated versions which combine Hebrew with other languages."

She began her music career in contemporary Christian music (CCM) before crossing over to pop music in the mid-1980s. Grant has been referred to as \"The Queen of Christian Pop\". Grant was formerly married to fellow Christian musician Gary Chapman; after their divorce in 1999, she married country music singer Vince Gill in 2000. Grant made her debut as a teenager, gaining fame in Christian music during the 1980s with hits such as \"Father's Eyes\", \"El Shaddai\", and \"Angels\". In the mid-1980s, she began broadening her audience and soon became one of the first CCM artists to cross over into mainstream pop on the heels of her successful albums Unguarded and Lead Me On. In 1986, she scored her first Billboard Hot 100 no. 1 song in a duet with Peter Cetera, \"The Next Time I Fall\". In 1991, she released the album Heart in Motion, which became her best-selling album, topping the Billboard Christian album chart for 32 weeks. It sold five million copies in the U.S. and produced her second no. 1 pop single \"Baby Baby\", as well as another three top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100: \"That's What Love Is For\", \"Every Heartbeat\" and \"Good for Me\". As of 2009, Grant had sold more than 30 million albums worldwide, won six Grammy Awards, 22 Gospel Music Association Dove Awards, and had the first Christian album to go platinum. She was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2006 for her contributions to the entertainment industry, and in 2022 she was announced as a recipient of the Kennedy Center Honors. Grant is the author of several books, including a memoir, Mosaic: Pieces of My Life So Far, and a book based on the popular Christmas song \"Breath of Heaven (Mary's Song)\" that she co-wrote."

It was first performed by Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli at the 1995 Sanremo Music Festival and recorded on his album of the same year, Bocelli. The single was first released as an A-side single with \"Vivere\" in 1995, topping the charts, first in France, where it became one of the best-selling singles of all-time, and then in Belgium, breaking the all-time record sales there. A second version of the song, sung partly in English, released in 1996 as \"Time to Say Goodbye\", paired Bocelli with British soprano Sarah Brightman, and achieved even greater success, topping charts all across Europe, including Germany, where it became the biggest-selling single in history. Brightman and Bocelli produced a version with Brightman singing in German and Bocelli in Italian, with this version being available on the CD Time to Say Goodbye. That version alone has now sold more than 12 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling singles of all time. The song is also known in its Spanish-language version \"Por ti volar\u00e9\" (\"For You I Shall Fly\")."

He rose to fame in 1994 after winning the newcomers' section of the 44th Sanremo Music Festival performing \"Il mare calmo della sera\". Since 1994, Bocelli has recorded 15 solo studio albums of both pop and classical music, three greatest hits albums, and nine complete operas, selling over 90 million records worldwide. He has had success as a crossover performer, bringing classical music to the top of international pop charts. His album Romanza is one of the best-selling albums of all time, while Sacred Arias is the biggest selling classical album by any solo artist in history. My Christmas was the best-selling holiday album of 2009 and one of the best-selling holiday albums in the United States. The 2019 album S\u00ec debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart and US Billboard 200, becoming Bocelli's first number-one album in both countries. His song \"Con te partir\u00f2\", a duet with Sarah Brightman taken from his second album Bocelli, is one of the best-selling singles of all time. In 1998, Bocelli was named one of People magazine's 50 Most Beautiful People. He duetted with Celine Dion on the song \"The Prayer\" for the animated film Quest for Camelot, which won the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song. In 1999, he was nominated for Best New Artist at the Grammy Awards. He captured a listing in the Guinness Book of World Records with the release of his classical album Sacred Arias, as he simultaneously held the top three positions on the US Classical Albums charts. Bocelli was made a Grand Officer of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic in 2006, and was honoured with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on 2 March 2010, for his contribution to Live Theater, and he was awarded a gold medal for Merit in Serbia in 2022. Singer Celine Dion has said that \"if God would have a singing voice, he must sound a lot like Andrea Bocelli\", and record producer David Foster has often described Bocelli's voice as the most beautiful in the world."

Gold performed on scores of records by other artists, especially Linda Ronstadt, and had his own success with the U.S. top 40 hits \"Lonely Boy\" (1977) and \"Thank You for Being a Friend\" (1978), as well as the UK top five hit \"Never Let Her Slip Away\" (1978). In the 1980s, he had further international chart success as one half of Wax, a collaboration with 10cc's Graham Gouldman. During the 1990s, Gold produced, composed, performed on and wrote tracks for films, commercials, and television soundtracks, such as \"Final Frontier\", the theme of the sitcom Mad About You. Some of his older works experienced newfound popularity: \"Thank You for Being a Friend\" sung by another performer was used as the opening theme for The Golden Girls, and the children's novelty song \"Spooky, Scary Skeletons\" (1996) became an Internet meme in the 2010s. In 1997, Gold released a tribute to 1960s psychedelic music, Greetings from Planet Love, issued under the pseudonym \"the Fraternal Order of the All\"."

        "text_description": "The Phantom of the Opera is a musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber, lyrics by Charles Hart, additional lyrics by Richard Stilgoe, and a libretto by Lloyd Webber and Stilgoe. Based on the novel by Gaston Leroux, it tells the tragic story of beautiful soprano Christine Daa\u00e9, who becomes the obsession of a mysterious and disfigured musical genius living in the subterranean labyrinth beneath the Paris Opera House. The musical opened in London's West End in 1986 and on Broadway in New York in 1988, in a production directed by Harold Prince and starring English classical soprano Sarah Brightman (Lloyd Webber's then-wife) as Christine Daa\u00e9, screen and stage star Michael Crawford as the Phantom, and international stage performer Steve Barton as Raoul. It won the 1986 Olivier Award and the 1988 Tony Award for Best Musical, with Crawford winning the Olivier and Tony for Best Actor in a Musical. A film adaptation, directed by Joel Schumacher, was released in 2004. The Phantom of the Opera is the longest running show in Broadway history, and celebrated its 10,000th performance on 11 February 2012, becoming the first Broadway production in history to do so. It is the second longest-running West End musical, after Les Mis\u00e9rables, and the third longest-running West End show overall, after The Mousetrap. With total estimated worldwide gross receipts of over $6 billion and total Broadway gross of over $1 billion, The Phantom of the Opera was the most financially successful entertainment event until The Lion King surpassed it in 2014. By 2019, it had been seen by over 140 million people in 183 cities across 41 countries. The original West End production at His Majesty's Theatre, London, suspended performances in March 2020 due to the shutdown of theatres resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. A revised staging reopened in the same theatre in July 2021, with a \"smaller orchestra and redesigned set\". The original Broadway production played its final performance on 16 April 2023. The musical is set to begin a North American tour in November 2025."

He sang with family members at a very young age. He began recording professionally in the early 1940s. In 1944 he married Ria Kuiper, and his daughter Willeke Alberti, later to become a successful Dutch vocalist herself, was born in 1945. After the war Alberti established himself in the Netherlands with Italian songs; he became increasingly popular in the 1950s, when he had a string of hits beginning with Nel blu dipinto di blu in 1958. In the 1960s he began to act alongside his daughter Willeke; as a duo, they also scored hits on the Dutch charts. From 1965 father and daughter presented a popular monthly television show for the AVRO. Alberti won two Edison Awards in the 1960s. In the 1970s, Alberti's fame began to decline, though he did score a few more hits. In 1984, Alberti was diagnosed with liver cancer, and he died in Amsterdam on 18 February of the following year, aged 58. He was cremated at the Westgaarde Crematorium in Amsterdam."

The first series was aired between 5 July and 30 August 2009 and was hosted by Edsilia Rombley. She was first replaced by singer and actor Victor Reinier (2010, 2011) before Jan Smit became the permanent host from 2012 to 2019. In each series a number of well-known performers take turns as the central artist in the hot seat that gets honoured by the other artists by singing songs that are of significance to that person. It can be a cover of one of his/her own songs, a song that inspires the artist in the hot seat or something from his/her past. In earlier seasons, the central artist decided who had to sing which song, while in later seasons the artists could pick one from a list themselves. The artist in the hot seat ranks the performances and picks a favourite performance, which results in that person being the winner of the episode. The first six seasons also have a final episode where they discuss and vote on their favourites. Later the voting became less important and they stopped doing this. In season 10 they introduced a final episode where the artists sing duets. The show format has since been used in other European countries: Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Germany, Belgium, Lithuania, Estonia and Switzerland. In July 2017 two compilations were broadcast in celebration of Beste Zangers' tenth anniversary."

The feast was assimilated by the Catholic Church, taking elements from ancient pagan spring festivals and is celebrated in the three days preceding the Christian holidays of Ash Wednesday and Lent. From an anthropological point of view, Carnival is a reversal ritual, in which social roles are reversed and norms about desired behavior are suspended. Winter was thought of as the reign of the winter spirits that were to be driven out for summer to return. Carnival can thus be regarded as a rite of passage from darkness to light, from winter to summer: a fertility celebration, the first spring festival of the new year. It precedes the Christian penitential season of Lent. The first day of Carnaval is six weeks before Easter Sunday. Carnival officially begins on Sunday and lasts three days until the start of Lent's first day, Ash Wednesday, at midnight. Nowadays the celebrations often start on Thursday evening though, which makes it in practice a six-day celebration. Many people in modern times do not relate the holiday at all with religion, but its date is still set before the start of the Christian season of Lent. In the southern part of the Netherlands during Carnival, normal daily life comes to a near stop. Roads are temporarily blocked and many local businesses close for the week because many employees take days off during and after Carnival. According to post-Napoleon tradition, the feast lasts from Sunday until Tuesday. In recent years the feast usually starts on Saturday. Also Friday evening (or at schools at Friday afternoon) and in some places Thursday (Ouwe Wijven) are considered the start of Carnival, which makes it a six days' celebration. The festivities last the entire day and well into the nights. Some parades and many balls and bonte avonden or other meetings are held in the weeks before the official Carnival, but never before the first official court meeting on 11 November. 11 is considered the fools' number, so 11-11 (De elfde van de elfde) at 11:11(:11) is a prominent moment. Historically the 40 days of Lent would start on Wednesday at midnight and continue until Easter. Nowadays it is still the official ending of Carnival, though some Carnival activities such as herring eating are traditionally held on Wednesday after Carnival. 20 days into Lent there might be another parade or festivities, called \"Half-Vasten\" (Half-Lent). Lent itself is generally not practiced anymore by the Southern Dutch population as a result of irreligion dominating the area nowadays."

The Canadian singer, who charted several hits from 1968 to 1971, had not had a top 100 single since September 1971, and had been without a record label since early 1973. Nevertheless, he said in a 1974 interview, \"I never mentally admitted defeat in spite of three years off the charts.\" He formed his own label, Ice Records, and personally financed the recording session that produced \"Rock Me Gently\". He could afford to record only two sides, and deciding the second side was good enough to be an A-side, he put an instrumental of \"Rock Me Gently\" on its B-side. The single impressed Capitol Records executives, who signed Kim to a deal. \"Rock Me Gently\" debuted on the Hot 100 on June 22, 1974, and took 14 weeks to reach No. 1 on September 28. It also rose to No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart and No. 10 in Ireland, and remains his only charting song in either the UK or Ireland. Even the instrumental B-side received substantial airplay on R&B stations. It would be Kim's last top 10 hit in either country."

In contrast to the lyrics of the soldiers\u2019 song, her version links the Union cause with God's vengeance at the Day of Judgment (through allusions to biblical passages such as Isaiah 63:1\u20136, Revelation 19 and Revelation 14:14\u201319). Julia Ward Howe was married to Samuel Gridley Howe, a scholar in education of the blind. Both Samuel and Julia were also active leaders in anti-slavery politics and strong supporters of the Union.

        "text_description": "R.E.M. was an American alternative rock band formed in Athens, Georgia, in 1980 by drummer Bill Berry, guitarist Peter Buck, bassist Mike Mills, and lead vocalist Michael Stipe, who were students at the University of Georgia. One of the first alternative rock bands, R.E.M. was noted for Buck's ringing, arpeggiated guitar playing, Stipe's distinctive vocal style, unique stage presence and cryptic lyrics, Mills's melodic bass lines and backing vocals, and Berry's tight, economical drumming. In the early 1990s, other alternative rock acts such as Nirvana, Pixies and Pavement named R.E.M. as a pioneer of the genre. After Berry left in 1997 due to severe health issues, the remaining members continued with mixed critical and commercial success. The band broke up amicably in 2011, having sold more than 90 million albums worldwide and becoming one of the world's best-selling music acts. The band released their first single, \"Radio Free Europe\", in 1981 on the independent record label Hib-Tone. It was followed by the Chronic Town EP in 1982, their first release on I.R.S. Records. Over the course of the decade, R.E.M. released acclaimed albums, commencing with their debut Murmur (1983), and continuing yearly with Reckoning (1984), Fables of the Reconstruction (1985), Lifes Rich Pageant (1986), Document (1987) and Green (1988). During their most successful period, they worked with the producer Scott Litt. With constant touring, and the support of college radio following years of underground success, R.E.M. achieved a mainstream hit with the 1987 single \"The One I Love\". They signed to Warner Bros. Records in 1988, and began to espouse political and environmental concerns while playing arenas worldwide. R.E.M.'s most commercially successful albums, Out of Time (1991) and Automatic for the People (1992), put them in the vanguard of alternative rock as it was becoming mainstream. Out of Time received seven nominations at the 34th Annual Grammy Awards, and the lead single, \"Losing My Religion\", was R.E.M.'s highest-charting and best-selling hit. Monster (1994) continued its run of success. The band began its first tour in six years to support the album; the tour was marred by medical emergencies suffered by three of the band members. In 1996, R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. for a reported US$80 million, at the time the most expensive recording contract ever. The tour was productive and the band recorded the following album mostly during soundchecks. The resulting record, New Adventures in Hi-Fi (1996), is hailed as the band's last great album and the members' favorite, growing in cult status over the years. Berry left the band the following year for health reasons, and Stipe, Buck and Mills continued as a musical trio, supplemented by studio and live musicians, such as the multi-instrumentalists Scott McCaughey and Ken Stringfellow and the drummers Joey Waronker and Bill Rieflin. They also parted ways with their longtime manager Jefferson Holt, at which point the band's attorney Bertis Downs assumed managerial duties. Seeking to also renovate their sound, the band stopped working with Litt, and hired as co-producer Pat McCarthy, who had worked as mixer and engineer on the band's previous two albums. After the electronic and experimental direction of Up (1998), which was commercially unsuccessful, Reveal (2001), referred to as \"a conscious return to their classic sound\", received general acclaim. In 2007, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in their first year of eligibility. Berry reunited with the band for the ceremony, and to record a cover of John Lennon's \"#9 Dream\" for the 2007 compilation album Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur to benefit Amnesty International's campaign to alleviate the Darfur conflict. Looking for a change of sound after lukewarm reception for Around the Sun (2004), the band collaborated with the producer Jacknife Lee on their final two studio albums\u2014the well-received Accelerate (2008) and Collapse into Now (2011). In 2024, the band reunited to perform \"Losing My Religion\" at their induction into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and once again in 2025 to perform \"Pretty Persuasion\" at the 40 Watt Club in Athens, Georgia."

        "text_description": "Puerto Rican singer Ricky Martin has recorded material for ten studio albums and sang songs in Spanish, English, Italian and Portuguese; he has also recorded bilingual tracks. He began his career aged 12, in 1984, as a lead singer of the band Menudo. Five years later he left the band and pursued a solo career, releasing his debut eponymous studio album in 1991. On the Spanish record, he collaborated with various songwriters and composers; \"Fuego Contra Fuego\", the lead single, was written by Carlos Gom\u00e9z and Mariano Perez, while on \"El Amor de Mi Vida\" he worked with Eddie Sierra. On the record, he also sang a Spanish version of Larry Williams' 1957 single \"Bony Moronie\", titled \"Popotitos\". In 1995, Martin teamed up with former band member, Robi Draco Rosa to work on his third studio album, A Medio Vivir, a record influenced by rock music and combined with Latin styles such as flamenco and cumbia. With Rosa's help several songs were penned for the record, including, \"Fuego de Noche, Nieve de D\u00eda\", \"Volver\u00e1s\" and \"Mar\u00eda\". The latter became a hit and was remixed as a bilingual English-Spanish version, released in 1998. Martin's fourth studio album, Vuelve, established his commercial music career in the United States. On it, Martin again worked with Rosa and other songwriters including Luis G\u00f3mez Escolar and K.C. Porter. \"La Copa de la Vida (The Cup of Life)\" penned by Escolar and Rosa together with Desmond Child became a worldwide hit and the official song of the 1998 FIFA World Cup. In 1999, Martin released \"Livin' la Vida Loca\", a track co-written by Rosa, Child, and Escolar; it became a worldwide success and Martin's best-selling single. It was succeeded by Martin's second eponymous studio album and his first English recording, that same year. Rosa and Child also co-wrote other songs on the album including, \"Spanish Eyes\" and \"I Am Made of You\". Madonna co-wrote and was featured on \"Be Careful (Cuidado Con Mi Coraz\u00f3n)\", a track penned and produced by William Orbit. The next year, the singer released his sixth overall and second English album, Sound Loaded (2000). Once again, Child and Rosa were involved in the writing process having done \"She Bangs\" and \"Saint Tropez\". Child, alongside Gary Burr and Victoria Shaw, penned the ballad, \"Nobody Wants to Be Lonely\", which was later remixed with additional vocals from Christina Aguilera. Almas del Silencio, Martin's seventh studio album, was released in 2003. For the Spanish record, Antonio Rayo, Jos\u00e9 Miguel Vel\u00e1squez and Jodi Marr co-wrote, \"Jaleo\", which was recorded in both Spanish and Spanglish versions. Following a two-year break, in 2005, Martin released his third English album, Life. On the record, he worked with producer Scott Storch who co-wrote, \"I Don't Care\", a song that featured rapper Fat Joe and singer Amerie. He collaborated with Diane Warren who co-wrote the ballad, \"Stop Time Tonight\". Martin's recording sessions with will.i.am resulted in two songs for the album, \"It's Alright\" and \"Drop It on Me\". Martin's ninth studio album, M\u00fasica + Alma + Sexo, was released in early 2011. A bilingual Spanish-English album, it was predominantly a dance and \"lite-pop\" record. Martin and Child co-wrote all the songs on the album, which featured recording artists Joss Stone on \"The Best Thing About Me Is You\" and Claudia Leitte on \"Samba\", a Portuguese recording. In 2014, he collaborated with Wisin and Jennifer Lopez on the song, \"Adrenalina\", which was released in two versions, Spanish and Spanglish. He sang \"Vida\" in Spanish, Portuguese and Spanglish; the latter version was part of the One Love, One Rhythm compilation. His tenth studio album, A Quien Quiera Escuchar was released in 2015; this Latin pop record also featured such artists as Rayo, Yotuel Romero, and Pedro Cap\u00f3."

It took place in Rotterdam, Netherlands, following the country's win at the 2019 contest with the song \"Arcade\" by Duncan Laurence. The Netherlands was set to host the 2020 contest, before it was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcasters Nederlandse Publieke Omroep (NPO), Nederlandse Omroep Stichting (NOS) and AVROTROS, the contest was held at Rotterdam Ahoy, and consisted of two semi-finals on 18 and 20 May, and a final on 22 May 2021. The three live shows were presented by Dutch television presenters and singers Chantal Janzen, Edsilia Rombley, and Jan Smit, and Dutch YouTuber and make-up artist Nikkie de Jager. Thirty-nine countries participated in the contest, of which twenty-six re-entered the artists chosen for 2020 (albeit with different songs, as per the contest's rules). Compared to the 2019 edition, Bulgaria and Ukraine returned while Hungary and Montenegro did not. Armenia and Belarus had originally planned to participate, but Armenia withdrew due to its social and political crises following the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War, and Belarus was disqualified after submitting entries in violation of the rules twice, and not providing an eligible entry before the deadline. The winner was Italy with the song \"Zitti e buoni\", performed by M\u00e5neskin and written by the band's members Damiano David, Ethan Torchio, Thomas Raggi, and Victoria De Angelis. France, Switzerland, Iceland and Ukraine rounded out the top five, with France and Switzerland achieving their best results since 1991 and 1993, respectively. Italy won the combined vote and televote, but placed fourth in the jury vote after Switzerland, France, and Malta. Italy was the second member of the \"Big Five\" since its introduction to win the contest after Germany in 2010. For the first time since 1995, none of the top three entries were performed in English, with France and Switzerland performing in French, and Italy in Italian. Also, for the first time since the current voting system was implemented in 2016, more than one country received no points from the televote in the final; these countries were Germany, Spain, the host country the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, the last of those becoming the first country to receive no points from both the jury and televote. It was the second time that the United Kingdom had received no points in the contest, the last time having been in 2003. For the first time since its debut in 2015, Australia failed to qualify for the final, making Ukraine the only country that has never failed to qualify from the semi-finals since their introduction in 2004. The EBU reported that the contest had an audience of 183 million viewers in 36 European markets, an increase of a million viewers from the previous edition, with an increase of seven percent in the 15\u201324 year old age range."

The song was a No. 2 hit on Canada's pop chart and went to No. 1 on both the Canadian adult contemporary and country charts. The song reached No. 8 on the U.S. pop singles chart, spent six weeks at No. 1 on the U.S. adult contemporary chart, and became a surprise Top 10 U.S. country hit as well. It was certified as a gold single by the RIAA, the first American Gold record ever awarded to a Canadian solo female artist. It peaked at No. 23 on the UK Singles Chart. In 2003 it was an inaugural song inductee of the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame. Anne Murray and Gene MacLellan had met while both were regulars on the CBC television series Singalong Jubilee and Murray recorded two of MacLellan's compositions, \"Snowbird\" and \"Biding My Time\", for her first major label album release, This Way Is My Way, in 1969. Murray would recall: \"Gene told me he wrote [\"Snowbird\"] in twenty minutes while walking on a beach on Prince Edward Island.\" \"Snowbird\" sold well over a million copies and was picked as 19th on the 50 Tracks: The Canadian Version list, a partially populist approach to defining the most influential songs by Canadians."

        "text_description": "\"Angel\" is a song by British pop duo Eurythmics from their seventh studio album, We Too Are One (1989). It was written by band members Annie Lennox and David A. Stewart and produced by Stewart and Jimmy Iovine. The song was released as the album's fourth UK single on 23 April 1990, and would be the duo's final single for almost a decade (discounting the re-release of two older singles the following year). It was also released as the second single from the album in the United States. Lennox said in an interview at the time that the song was inspired by the death of her aunt, as she sings about a woman who has killed herself and now has \"gone to meet her maker\". The music video, directed by Sophie Muller, features the duo taking part in a seance and running through a burning house, and was not widely seen in the US (not shown at all on MTV) supposedly due to several scenes depicting the occult. \"Angel\" peaked at number 23 on the UK Singles Chart, though failed to chart on the US Billboard Hot 100. Lennox re-recorded the song in 1997 for the Diana, Princess of Wales: Tribute album."

It was released as the fourth and final single from their second album of the same name in January 1983. It was their breakthrough hit, establishing the duo worldwide. It reached number two on the UK Singles Chart in March 1983, and number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 six months later; it was their first single released in the US. With Annie Lennox appearing with orange cropped hair and wearing a man's business suit in the music video, the BBC stated Lennox's \"powerful androgynous look\" was the music video that \"broke the mold for female pop stars\u201c. Rolling Stone called the song \"a synth-pop masterpiece that made Lennox and Dave Stewart MTV superstars\". After the song's rise, the duo's previous single, \"Love Is a Stranger\", was re-released and also became a worldwide hit. On Rolling Stone's The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time issue in 2003, \"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)\" was ranked number 356. In 2020, the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. In 2023, it was selected by the US Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry. Eurythmics have regularly performed the song in all their live sets since its release\u2014with an early television performance coming on the BBC's Top of the Pops in February 1983\u2014and it is often performed by Lennox on her solo tours. Recorded by Eurythmics in a small project studio in the attic of an old warehouse in North London where they were living, the song's success heralded a trend of musicians abandoning larger recording studios for home recording methods. In 1991, the song was remixed and reissued to promote Eurythmics' Greatest Hits album. It re-charted in the UK, reaching number 48, and was also a moderate hit in dance clubs. Another remix by Steve Angello was released in France in 2006, along with the track \"I've Got a Life\"."

The song, and its accompanying album, featured a full backing band and relied less on electronic programming. Lyrically, the song features Lennox confronting a cheating lover as she leaves him for good. This was conveyed in the music video for the single, in which actor Steven Bauer played the part of the boyfriend. The video was directed by Mary Lambert and was shown heavily on MTV. The front and back cover photos, and the inner cover art of the Be Yourself Tonight album are screenshots from the music video. \"Would I Lie to You?\" is one of Eurythmics' most recognised tunes and continued the band's run of hit singles. In the UK, the song peaked at number 17, while it went to number five on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, becoming their third and last Top 10 hit in the U.S. Furthermore, it is the duo's biggest hit in Australia, where it topped the Kent Music Report for two weeks.

She is considered, by many experts, one of the most important and expressive female voices of Italian music, characterised by her interpretative intensity and her soulful performance. Her debut album, Oltre la collina with the song \"Padre davvero\" is regarded as one of the best Italian albums made by a female artist. Hit songs like \"Piccolo uomo\", \"Donna sola\", \"Minuetto\", \"Inno\", \"Al mondo\", \"Che vuoi che sia se t'ho aspettato tanto\", \"Per amarti\" and \"La costruzione di un amore\" made her one of the most popular artists of Italian music in the 1970s, both nationally and internationally. She is the only female artist to have won two Festivalbar consecutively, respectively in 1972 and in 1973. In 1977, two important encounters occurred in Martini's life: the first with Charles Aznavour, with whom she began a musical collaboration, and the second with singer-songwriter Ivano Fossati, with whom she started an artistic and sentimental partnership. In 1982, she sang \"E non finisce mica il cielo\", written by Fossati, at the Sanremo Music Festival, where she received the Critics Award, which was created specifically for her interpretation and which was named after her as \"Mia Martini\" Critics Awards from 1996, the year after her death. In 1983, she was forced to leave the music industry and quit her career, as the music sector and colleagues considered her a person bringing bad luck and barred her from participating in any music and TV events, radio shows and concerts. This kept her away from the music scene for seven years. Only in 1989 was she able to reprise her career, when she returned to perform at the Sanremo Music Festival, singing \"Almeno tu nell'universo\", which brought her a new success. Martini's later hits included \"Gli uomini non cambiano\", \"La nevicata del '56\" and \"Cu' mme\", the latter with Roberto Murolo. She represented Italy at the Eurovision Song Contest twice, in 1977 with the song \"Libera\" and in 1992 with \"Rapsodia\". She died of drug overdose on 12 May 1995."
